\section*{Abstract\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(eLife: 150 words)}\DIFdelend }

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to be important for
learning from feedback, and biasing and invigorating behavior in
response to outcome-predictive cues. NAc encodes outcome-related cue
features such as the magnitude and identity of reward. However, not
much is known about how features of cues themselves are encoded.  We
designed a decision making task where rats learned multiple sets of
outcome-predictive cues, and recorded single-unit activity in the NAc
during performance. We found that coding of various cue features
occurred alongside coding of expected outcome. Furthermore, this
coding persisted during a delay period, after the rat made a decision
and was waiting for an outcome, but not after the outcome was
revealed. Encoding of cue features in the NAc may enable contextual
modulation of ongoing behavior, and provide an eligibility trace of
outcome-predictive stimuli for updating stimulus-outcome associations
to inform future behavior.

\section*{Introduction}

Theories of nucleus accumbens (NAc) function generally agree that this
brain structure contributes to motivated behavior, with some
emphasizing a role in learning from RPEs \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

) }\DIFaddend and others a role in
the modulation of ongoing behavior through stimuli associated with
motivationally relevant outcomes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

proposals echo similar ideas on the functions of the neuromodulator
dopamine \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

which the NAc is tightly linked functionally as well as anatomically

Much of our understanding of NAc function comes from studies of how
cues that predict motivationally relevant outcomes (e.g.\ reward)
influence behavior and neural activity in the NAc. Task designs that
associate such cues with rewarding outcomes provide a convenient
access point eliciting conditioned responses such as sign-tracking and
goal-tracking \cite{hearst1974sign,Robinson2009},
pavlovian-instrumental transfer \cite{Estes1943,Rescorla1967} and
enhanced response vigor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Niv2007,Nicola2010a}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , which tend to be
affected by NAc manipulations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

;
although not always

\citeNP{Giertler2004,Chang2013}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
)}\DIFaddend . Similarly, analysis
of RPEs typically proceeds by establishing an association between a
cue and subsequent reward, with NAc responses transferring from
outcome to the cue with learning
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Day2007a,Roitman2005,Setlow2003,Schultz1997}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend .

Surprisingly, although substantial work has been done on the coding of
outcomes predicted by such cues
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Atallah2014,Bissonette2013,Cooch2015,Day2006,Goldstein2012,Hollerman1998,Lansink2012,McGinty2013,Nicola2004,Roesch2009a,Roitman2005,Saddoris2011,Setlow2003,Sugam2014,West2016}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend ,
much less is known about how outcome-predictive cues themselves are
encoded in the NAc \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Sleezer2016}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite[but see;][]{Sleezer2016}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . This is an important issue for
at least two reasons. First, in reinforcement learning, motivationally
relevant outcomes are typically temporally delayed relative to the
cues that predict them. In order to solve the problem of assigning
credit (or blame) across such temporal gaps, some trace of preceding
activity needs to be maintained \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Lee2012,sutton1998}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{sutton1998,Lee2012}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . For
example, if you become ill after eating food X in restaurant A,
depending on if you remember the identity of the restaurant or the
food at the time of illness, you may learn to avoid all restaurants,
restaurant A only, food X only, or the specific pairing of
X-in-A. Therefore, a complete understanding of what is learned
following feedback requires understanding what “trace” is
maintained. Since NAc is a primary target of DA signals interpretable
as reward prediction errors (RPEs), and NAc lesions impair RPEs
related to timing, its activity trace will help determine what can be
learned when RPEs arrive
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Hamid2016,Hart2014,Ikemoto2007,McDannald2011,Takahashi2016}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Ikemoto2007,McDannald2011,Hart2014,Hamid2016,Takahashi2016}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .


Second, for ongoing behavior, the relevance of cues typically depends
on “context”. In experimental settings, context may include the
identity of a preceding cue, spatial or configural arrangements
\cite{Holland1992,Bouton1993,Honey2014}, and unsignaled rules as
occurs in set shifting and other cognitive control tasks
\cite{Grant1948,cohen1992context,Floresco2006a,Sleezer2016}. In such
situations, the question arises how selective, context-dependent
processing of outcome-predictive cues is implemented. For instance, is
there a “gate” prior to NAc \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{such that only currently relevant cues are encoded in NAc}\DIFaddend , or are all cues represented in NAc but
their current values dynamically updated
\cite{Goto2008,Fitzgerald2014,Sleezer2016}. Representation of cue
identity would allow for context-dependent mapping of outcomes
predicted by specific cues.

Thus, both from a learning and a flexible performance perspective, it
is of interest to determine how cue identity is represented in the
brain, with NAc of particular interest given its anatomical and
functional position at the center of motivational systems. We sought
to determine whether cue identity is represented in the NAc, if cue
identity is represented alongside other motivationally relevant
variables, such as cue value, and if these representations are
maintained after a behavioral decision has been made (Figure
\ref{fig:schematic}). To address these questions, we recorded the
activity of NAc units as rats performed a task in which multiple,
distinct sets of cues predicted the same outcome.

  period until outcome is revealed. Coding can either be maintained by
  the same unit as during cue-onset (H2A) or by a sequence of units
  (H2B). H3 (right panel): Coding of cue identity persists after the outcome is received when the rat gets feedback about his decision,
  by either the same unit as during cue-onset (H3A) or by a sequence of units (H3B). The
  same hypotheses apply to other information-containing aspects of the
  environment when the cue is presented, such as the physical location
  of the cue.}

\section*{Methods}

{\bf Subjects:}

Adult male Long-Evans rats (n = 4, Charles River, Saint Constant, QC)
were used as subjects. Rats were individually housed with a 12/12-h
light-dark cycle, and tested during the light cycle. Rats were food
deprived to 85-90\% of their free feeding weight (weight at time of
implantation was 440 - 470 g), and water restricted 4-6 hours before
testing. All experimental procedures were approved by the the
University of Waterloo Animal Care Committee (protocol\# 11-06) and
carried out in accordance with Canadian Council for Animal Care (CCAC)
guidelines.

{\bf Overall timeline:}

Each rat was first handled for seven days during which they were
exposed to the experiment room, the sucrose solution used as a
reinforcer, and the click of the sucrose dispenser valves. Rats were
then trained on the behavioral task (described in the next section)
until they reached performance criterion. At this point they
underwent hyperdrive implantation targeted at the NAc. Rats were
allowed to recover for a minimum of five days before being retrained
on the task, and recording began once performance returned to
pre-surgery levels. Upon completion of recording, animals were gliosed,
euthanized and recording sites were histologically confirmed.

{\bf Behavioral task and training:}

The behavioral apparatus was an elevated, square-shaped track (100 x
100 cm, track width 10 cm) containing four possible reward locations
at the end of track ``arms'' (Figure \ref{fig:task}). Rats initiated a
{\it trial} by triggering a photobeam located 24 cm from the start of
each arm. Upon trial initiation, one of two possible light cues (L1,
L2), or one of two possible sound cues (S1, S2), was presented that
signaled the presence ({\it reward-available trial}, L1+, S1+) or
absence ({\it reward-unavailable trial}, L2-, S2-) of a 12\% sucrose
water reward (0.1 mL) at the upcoming reward site. A trial was
classified as an {\it approach trial} if the rat turned left at the
decision point and made a nosepoke at the reward receptacle (40 cm
from the decision point), while trials were classified as a {\it skip
trial} if the rat instead turned right at the decision point and
triggered the photobeam to initiate the next trial. A trial is labeled
{\it correct} if the rat approached (i.e.\ nosepoked) on
reward-available trials, and skipped (i.e.\ did not nosepoke) on
reward-unavailable trials. On reward-available trials there was a 1
second delay between a nosepoke and subsequent reward delivery. {\it
Trial length} was determined by measuring the length of time from
cue onset until nosepoke (for approach trials), or from cue onset
until the start of the following trial (for skip trials). Trials could
only be initiated through clockwise progression through the series of
arms, and each entry into the subsequent arm on the track counted as a
trial.

Each session consisted of both a {\it light block} and a {\it sound block} with
100 trials each. Within a block, one cue signaled reward was available on that
trial (L1+ or S1+), while the other signaled reward was not available (L2- or
S2-). Light block cues were a flashing white light, and a constant yellow
light. Sound block cues were a 2 kHz sine wave and a 8 kHz sine wave whose
amplitude was modulated from 0 to maximum by a 2 Hz sine wave. Outcome-cue
associations were counterbalanced across rats, e.g.\ for some rats L1+ was the
flashing white light, and for others L1+ was the constant yellow light. The
order of cue presentation was pseudorandomized so that the same cue could not be
presented more than twice in a row. Block order within each day was also
pseudorandomized, such that the rat could not begin a session with the same
block for more than two days in a row. Each session consisted of a 5 minute
pre-session period on a pedestal (a terracotta planter filled with towels),
followed by the first block, then the second block, then a 5 minute post-session
period on the pedestal. For approximately the first week of training, rats were restricted to
running in the clockwise direction by presenting a physical barrier to
running counterclockwise. Cues signaling the availability and
unavailability of reward, as described above, were present from the
start of training. Rats were trained for 200 trials per day (100
trials per block) until they discriminated between the reward-available and reward-unavailable cues for both light and
sound blocks for three consecutive days, according to a chi-square test
rejecting the null hypothesis of equal approaches for reward-available and
reward-unavailable trials, at which point they underwent electrode implant
surgery.

example trajectory for a correct reward-available (approach trial; red) and reward-unavailable
(skip trial; green) trial. Right in figure depicts a sound block, with a reward-available
(approach trial; navy blue) and reward-unavailable (skip trial; light blue) trial. Ordering of the light and sound blocks was counterbalanced across sessions. Reward-available and reward-unavailable cues were presented pseudo-randomly, such that not more than two of the same type of cue could be presented in a row. Location of the cue on the track was irrelevant for
behavior, all cue locations contained an equal amount of reward-available and
reward-unavailable trials.

{\bf Surgery:}

Surgical procedures were as described previously
\cite{Malhotra2015}. Briefly, animals were administered analgesics and
antibiotics, anesthetized with isoflurane, induced with 5\% in medical
grade oxygen and maintained at 2\% throughout the surgery (~0.8
L/min). Rats were then chronically implanted with a ``hyperdrive''
consisting of 16 independently drivable tetrodes, either all 16
targeted for the right NAc (AP +1.4 mm and ML +1.6 mm relative to
bregma; \citeNP{atlas}), or 12 in the right NAc and 4 targeted at the
mPFC (AP +3.0 mm and ML +0.6 mm, relative to bregma; only data from
NAc tetrodes was analyzed). Following surgery, all animals were given
at least five days to recover while receiving post-operative care, and
tetrodes were lowered to the target (DV -6.0 mm) before being
reintroduced to the behavioral task.

{\bf Data acquisition and preprocessing:}

After recovery, rats were placed back on the task for recording. NAc
signals were acquired at 20 kHz with a RHA2132 v0810 preamplifier
(Intan) and a KJE-1001/KJD-1000 data acquisition system
(Amplipex). Signals were referenced against a tetrode placed in the
corpus callosum above the NAc. Candidate spikes for sorting into
putative single units were obtained by band-pass filtering the data
between 600-9000 Hz, thresholding and aligning the peaks \cite[UltraMegaSort2k, ][]{Hill2011}. Spike waveforms were then
clustered with KlustaKwik using energy and the first derivative of
energy as features, and manually sorted into units (MClust 3.5,
A.D.\ Redish et al., http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/MClust/MClust.html). Isolated units containing a minimum of 200
spikes within a session were included for subsequent analysis. Units
were classified as fast spiking interneurons (FSIs) by an absence of
interspike intervals (ISIs) $>$ 2 s, while medium spiny neurons (MSNs)
had a combination of ISIs $>$ 2 s and phasic activity with shorter
ISIs \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

{\bf Data analysis:}

{\it Behavior.} To determine if rats distinguished behaviorally
between the reward-available and reward-unavailable cues ({\it cue
outcome}), we generated linear mixed effects models to investigate
the relationships between cue type and our behavioral variables, with
{\it cue outcome} (reward available or not) and {\it cue identity}
(light or sound) as fixed effects, and the addition of an intercept
for rat identity as a random effect. For each cue, the average
proportion of trials approached and trial length for a session were
used as response variables. Contribution of cue outcome to behavior
was determined by comparing the full model to a model with cue outcome
removed for each behavioral variable.

{\it Neural data.} To investigate the contribution of different cue
features {cue identity and cue outcome) on the firing rates of NAc
single units, we first determined whether firing rates for a unit
were modulated by the onset of a cue by collapsing across all cues
and comparing the firing rates for the 1 s preceding cue-onset with
the 1 s following cue-onset. Single units were considered to be {\it
cue-modulated} if a Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing pre- and
post-cue firing was significant at $p <$ .01. Cue-modulated units
were then classified as either increasing or decreasing if the
post-cue activity was higher or lower than the pre-cue activity,
respectively.

To determine the relative contribution of different task parameters to
firing rate variance (as in Figures \ref{fig:examples}-\ref{fig:GLM}),
a forward selection stepwise general linear model (GLM) was fit to
each cue-modulated unit. Cue identity (light block, sound block), cue
location (arm 1, arm 2, arm 3, arm 4), cue outcome (reward-available,
reward-unavailable), behavior (approach, skip), trial length, trial
number, and trial history (reward availability on the previous 2
trials) were used as predictors, and the 1 s post-cue firing rate as
the response variable. Units were classified as being modulated by a
given task parameter if addition of the parameter significantly
improved model fit using deviance as the criterion ($p <$ .01). A
comparison of the R-squared value between the final model and the
final model minus the predictor of interest was used to determine the
amount of firing rate variance explained by the addition of that
predictor for a given unit. To investigate more finely the temporal dynamics of the influence of task parameters to unit activity, we then fit a sliding window GLM with the
same task parameters using 500 ms bins and 100 ms steps, starting 500 ms before cue-onset, up to 500 ms after cue-onset, and measured the proportion of units and average R-squared value for a given time bin
where a particular predictor contributed significantly to the final model. To control for \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend amount of units that would be affected by a predictor by chance, we shuffled the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{trial }\DIFaddend order of firing rates \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{used for a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for a particular unit within a }\DIFaddend time bin, and took the average of this value over 100 shuffles.

To better visualize responses to cues and enable subsequent population
level analyses (as in Figures \ref{fig:examples}, \ref{fig:pop}, and
\ref{fig:tiling}), spike trains were convolved with a Gaussian kernel
($\sigma$ = 100 ms), and peri-event time histograms (PETHs) were
generated by taking the average of the convolved spike trains across all
trials for a given task condition. For analysis of population-level
responses for cue features (Figure \ref{fig:pop}), convolved spike
trains for all units where cue identity, cue location, or cue outcome
explained a significant portion of firing rate variance were
z-scored. Within a given cue feature, normalized spike trains were
then separated according to the preferred and non-preferred cue
condition (e.g.\ light vs.\ sound block), and averaged across units to
generate population-level averages. To account for separation that
would result from any random selection of units, unit identity was
shuffled and the shuffled average for preferred and non-preferred cue
conditions was generated for 1000 shuffles.

To visualize NAc representations of task space within cue conditions,
normalized spike trains for all units were ordered by the location of
their maximum or minimum firing rate for a specified cue condition
(Figure \ref{fig:tiling}). To compare representations of task space
across cue conditions for a cue feature, the ordering of units derived
for one condition (e.g.\ light block) was then applied to the
normalized spike trains for the other condition (e.g.\ sound
block). For control comparisons within cue conditions, half of the
trials for a condition were compared against the other half. To look
at the correlation of firing rates of all units within and across
various cue conditions, trials for each cue condition for a unit were
shuffled and divided into two averages, and averages within and across
cue conditions were correlated. A linear mixed effects model was run
for each cue condition to determine if correlations of firing rates
within cue conditions were more similar than correlations across cue
conditions.

To identify the responsivity of units to different cue features at the
time of a nosepoke into a reward receptacle, and subsequent reward
delivery, the same cue-responsive units from the cue-onset analyses
were analyzed at the time of nosepoke and outcome receipt using
identical analysis techniques (Figures \ref{fig:NP_examples},
\ref{fig:NP_GLM}, \ref{fig:NP_pop}, and \ref{fig:NP_tiling}).

Given that some of our analyses compare firing rates across time,
particularly comparisons across blocks, we sought to exclude units
with unstable firing rates that would generate spurious results
reflecting a drift in firing rate over time unrelated to our task. To
do this we ran a Mann-Whitney U test comparing the cue-evoked firing
rates for the first and second half of trials within a block, and
excluded 99 of 443 units from analysis that showed a significant change for
either block, leaving 344 units for further analyses. All analyses were completed in MATLAB R2015a, the code
is available on our public GitHub repository
(http://github.com/vandermeerlab/papers), and the data can be accessed
through DataLad.

{\bf Histology:}

Upon completion of the experiment, recording channels were gliosed by passing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{150 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{10 }\DIFaddend $\mu A$ current for 10 seconds and waiting 5 days before euthanasia, except for rat R057 whose implant detached prematurely. Rats were anesthetized with 5\%
isoflurane, then asphyxiated with carbon dioxide. Transcardial
perfusions were performed, and brains were fixed and removed. Brains
were sliced in 50 $\mu m$ coronal sections and stained with
thionin. Slices were visualized under light microscopy, tetrode
placement was determined, and electrodes with recording locations in
the NAc were analyzed (Figure \ref{fig:histo}).

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Behavior}

Rats were trained to discriminate between cues signaling the
availability and absence of reward on a square track with four
identical arms for two distinct set of cues (Figure
\ref{fig:task}). During each session, rats were presented sequentially
with two behavioral blocks containing cues from different sensory
modalities, a light and a sound block, with each block containing a
cue that signalled the availability of reward (reward-available), and
a cue that signalled the absence of reward (reward-unavailable). To
maximize reward receipt, rats should approach reward sites on
reward-available trials, and skip reward sites on reward-unavailable
trials (see Figure \ref{fig:behav}A for an example learning
curve). All four rats learned to discriminate between the
reward-available and reward-unavailable cues for both the light and
sound blocks as determined by reaching significance ($p <$ .05) on a
daily chi-square test comparing approach behavior for reward-available
and reward-unavailable cues for each block, for at least three
consecutive days (range for time to criterion: 22 - 57
days). Maintenance of behavioral performance during recording sessions
was assessed using linear mixed effects models for both proportion of
trials where the rat approached the receptacle, and trial
length. Analyses revealed that the likelihood of a rat to make an
approach was influenced by whether a reward-available or reward-unavailable cue was presented, but was not significantly modulated by whether the rat was presented with a light or sound cue (Percentage
approached: light reward-available = 97\%; light reward-unavailable =
34\%; sound reward-available = 91\%; sound reward-unavailable 35\%; cue identity p
$=$ .115; cue outcome p$<$ .001; Figure \ref{fig:behav}B). A similar trend was seen with the
length of time taken to complete a trial (Trial length: light
reward-available = 1.85 s; light reward-unavailable = 1.74 s; sound
reward-available = 1.91 s; sound reward-unavailable 1.78 s; cue identity p $=$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.115}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.106}\DIFaddend ; cue outcome p $<$ .001; Figure \ref{fig:behav}C). Thus, during recording, rats successfully
discriminated the cues according to whether or not they signaled the
availability of reward at the reward receptacle.

for statistics). \bsf{C}: Average trial length for each cue. Note that the

\subsection*{NAc units encode behaviorally relevant and irrelevant cue features}

{\bf Single unit responses discriminate cue features:}

We sought to address which parameters of our task were encoded by NAc activity,
specifically whether the NAc encodes aspects of motivationally relevant cues not
directly tied to reward, such as the identity and location of the cue, and
whether this coding is independent or integrated with coding of cue outcome. To
do this we recorded a total of 443 units with $>$ 200 spikes in the NAc from 4
rats over 57 sessions while they performed a cue discrimination task (Table
\ref{tbl1}). Units that exhibited a drift in firing rate over the course of
either block were excluded from further analysis, leaving 344 units for further
analysis. The activity of 133 (39\%) of these 344 units were modulated by the
cue, with more showing a decrease in firing (n = 103) than an increase (n = 30)
around the time of cue-onset (Table \ref{tbl1}). Within this group, 24 were
classified as FSIs, while 109 were classified as SPNs. Upon visual inspection,
we observed several patterns of firing activity, including units that
discriminated firing upon cue-onset across various cue conditions, showed
sustained differences in firing across cue conditions, had transient responses
to the cue, showed a ramping of activity starting at cue-onset, and showed
elevated activity immediately preceding cue-onset, for example (Figure
\ref{fig:examples}). To characterize more formally whether these cue-evoked
responses were modulated by various aspects of the task, we fit a GLM to each
cue-modulated unit. Fitting GLMs revealed that a variety of task parameters
accounted for a significant portion of firing rate variance in NAc cue-modulated
units (Figure \ref{fig:GLM}, Table \ref{tbl1}). Notably, there were units that
discriminated between whether the rat was performing in the light or sound block
(28\% of cue-modulated units, accounting for 6\% of variance on average), which
arm the rat was currently on (38\% of cue-modulated units, accounting for 6\% of
variance on average), and whether the rat was engaged in the common portion of a
reward-available or reward-unavailable trial (26\% of cue-modulated units,
accounting for 4\% of variance on average), suggesting that the NAc
encodes features of reward-predictive cues separate from expected
outcome (Figure \ref{fig:examples}A-F). Furthermore, overlap of coding of cue
features within units was not different than expected by chance according to
chi-square tests, suggesting for integrated coding across various aspects of a
cue (Figure \ref{fig:examples}G,H). Additionally, a sliding window GLM centered on cue-onset revealed that cue identity and cue location contributed to the activity
of a significant proportion of cue-modulated units throughout this epoch, whereas an increase in units encoding cue outcome became apparent after cue-onset (Figure \ref{fig:GLM}D).  Together, these findings show that various cue features are represented in the NAc, 
and that this coding is both integrated and separate from expected outcome (Figure
\ref{fig:schematic}; H2,H3).

{\bf Population level averages reveal characteristic response profiles:}

We observed a variety of single unit response profiles around the time of cue
onset (Figure \ref{fig:examples}). To investigate whether these firing rate
patterns were related to what cue features were encoded, we plotted the
population level averages for units that were modulated by each feature. To do
this, we normalized firing activity for each unit that was modulated by a given
cue feature, such as light block, then generated the cue-onset aligned
population average firing rate for each of the cue features (Figure
\ref{fig:pop}). Overall, this analysis revealed that cells that showed an
increase upon cue presentation had stronger responses for the preferred cue
condition (Figure \ref{fig:pop}A,C,E). Interestingly, units that were classified
as decreasing in response to the cue showed a biphasic response at the
population level, with a small peak at a time in alignment with entry into the
arm, followed by a sustained dip after cue-onset (Figure
\ref{fig:pop}B,D,F). Units that were modulated by cue identity showed a stronger
increase in response to the preferred task block, as well as a higher tonic
firing rate to the preferred task block, most notably in units that decreased in
firing rate to the cue (Figure \ref{fig:pop}A,B). Units that were modulated by
cue location showed a graded response to locations of decreasing preference,
with peak firing occurring around cue-onset (Figure \ref{fig:pop}C,D). Units
that were modulated by cue outcome showed a ramping of activity after cue-onset
for their preferred cue type. Additionally, units that exhibited a decrease in
firing in response to the cue and whose activity was modulated by cue outcome,
showed a sustained discriminatory response to reward-available and
reward-unavailable cues that extended beyond cue-onset (Figure
\ref{fig:pop}F). Together, these visualizations of the averaged population
responses revealed nuanced differences in the way NAc units are modulated by cue
conditions across cue features.

{\bf NAc units dynamically segment the task:}

Given the varied time courses and response profiles of NAc units to various
aspects of the cue, the NAc may be computing a temporally evolving state value
signal (Pennartz., 2011). If this is the case, then the recruitment of NAc units
should vary alongside changes in the environment. To look at the distribution of
responses throughout our task space and see if this distribution is modulated by
cue features, we z-scored the firing rate of each unit and plotted the
normalized firing rates of all units aligned to cue-onset and sorted them
according to the time of peak firing rate (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}). We did this
separately for both the light and sound blocks, and found a nearly uniform
distribution of firing fields in task space that was not limited to alignment to
the cue (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}A). Furthermore, to determine if this population
level activity was similar across blocks, we also organized firing during the
sound blocks according to the ordering derived from the light \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Blocks}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{blocks}\DIFaddend . This revealed that while there was some preservation of order, the overall firing was qualitatively different
across the two blocks, implying that population activity distinguishes between light and sound blocks. To control for the possibility that any comparison of
trials would produce this effect, we did a within block comparison, comparing
half of the trials in the light block against the other half. This comparison
looked similar to our test comparison of sound block trials ordered by light
block trials. Additionally, given that the majority of our units showed an
inhibitory response to the cue, we also plotted the firing rates according to
the lowest time in firing, and again found some maintenance of order, but
largely different ordering across the two blocks, and the within block
comparison (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{B}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{D}\DIFaddend ). To further test this, we divided each
block into two halves and looked at the correlation of the average smoothed
firing rates across various combinations of these halves across our cue-aligned
centered epoch. A linear mixed effects model revealed that within block
correlations (e.g. one half of light trials vs other half of light trials) were
higher and more similar than across block correlations (e.g. half of light
trials vs half of sound trials) suggesting that activity in the NAc
discriminates across various cue conditions (within block correlations = .383 (light), .379 (sound); across block correlations = .343, .338, .337, .348; within block vs.\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend within block comparison = p $=$ .934; within block vs.\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend across block comparisons = p $<$ .001). This process was repeated for cue location (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C-D}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{B,E}\DIFaddend ; within block correlations = .369 (arm 1), .350 (arm 2); across block correlations = .290, .286, .285, .291; within block vs.\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend within block comparison = p $=$ .071; within block vs.\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend across block comparisons = p $<$ .001) and cue outcome (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{E-F}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C,F}\DIFaddend ;  within block correlations = .429 (reward-available), .261 (reward-unavailable); across block correlations = .258, .253, .255, .249; within block vs.\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend within block comparison = p $<$ .001; within block vs.\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend across block comparisons = p $<$ .001), showing that NAc segmentation of the task is qualitatively
different even during those parts of the task not immediately associated with a
specific cue, action, or outcome, although the within condition comparison of
reward-unavailable trials was less correlated than reward-available trials, and
more similar to the across condition comparisons, potentially due do the greater behavioral variability for the reward-unavailable trials.

{\bf Encoding of cue features persists until outcome:}

In order to be useful for credit assignment in reinforcement learning, a trace
of the cue must be maintained until the outcome, so that information about the
outcome can be associated with the outcome-predictive cue. To test whether
representations of cue features persisted post-approach until the outcome
was revealed, we fit a GLM to the post-approach firing rates of cue-modulated
units aligned to the time of nosepoke into the reward receptacle. This analysis
showed that a variety of units still discriminated firing according to various
cue features, but not other task parameters, showing that NAc activity
discriminates various cue conditions well into a trial (Table \ref{tbl1},
Figures \ref{fig:NP_examples},\ref{fig:NP_GLM}). Additionally, these units were
a mix between most of the units that encoded cue features at cue-onset (observed
overlap greater than expected by chance according to chi-square tests), and those
that did not previously have a cue feature as a predictor (29, 48, and 30 out of 133 cue-modulated units encoded both time points for cue identity, cue location, and cue outcome,
respectively). Population level averages for units that increased to
cue-onset showed a ramping up of activity that peaked upon nosepoke, whereas
units that decreased to cue-onset showed a gradual reduction of firing activity
that reached a minimum upon nosepoke (Figure \ref{fig:NP_pop}). Additionally, a
peak is seen for preferred cue outcome in decreasing units at 1 second post
cue-onset when reward was received, demonstrating an integration of expected and
received reward (Figure \ref{fig:NP_pop}F). Furthermore, aligning normalized
peak firing rates to nosepoke onset, revealed a clustering of responses around
outcome receipt for all cue conditions where the rat would have received reward
(Figure \ref{fig:NP_tiling})\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, in addition to the same trend of higher within- vs across-block correlations for cue identity (Figure \ref{fig:NP_tiling}A,C; within block correlations = .560 (light), .541 (sound); across block correlations = .487, .481, .483, .486; within block vs. within block comparison = p $=$ .112; within block vs. across block comparisons = p $<$ .001) and cue location (Figure \ref{fig:NP_tiling}B,E; within block correlations = .474 (arm 1), .461 (arm 2); across block correlations = .416, .402, .416, .415; within block vs. within block comparison = p $=$ .810; within block vs. across block comparisons = p $<$ .001), but not cue outcome (Figure \ref{fig:NP_tiling}C,F; within block correlations = .620 (reward-available), .401 (reward-unavailable); across block correlations = .418, .414, .390, .408; within block vs. within block comparison = p $<$ .001; within block vs. across block comparisons = p $<$ .001). }\DIFaddend To determine whether coding of cue features persisted after the outcome was revealed, a GLM was fit to the firing rates of
cue-modulated units at the time of outcome receipt, during which the cue was
still present. Fitting a GLM revealed 10 units (8\%) where cue outcome accounted
for an average of 32\% of firing rate variance (Table \ref{tbl1}, data not
shown). An absence of cue identity or cue location coding at this level of analysis was observed,
but looking at the data more closely with a sliding window GLM revealed that
cue identity, cue location, and cue outcome were encoded throughout time epochs surround cue-onset, nosepoke hold, and outcome receipt,
suggesting that the NAc maintains a representation of these cue features once the rat receives behavioral feedback for its decision (Figure \ref{fig:NP_GLM}E-J).

\section*{Discussion}

The main result of the present study is that NAc units encode not
only the expected outcome of outcome-predictive cues, but also the
identity of such cues. Importantly, this identity coding was
maintained on approach trials during a delay period where the rat held
a nosepoke until the outcome was received (H2 in Figure
\ref{fig:schematic}B). Units coding for cue identity showed partial
overlap with those coding for expected outcome (H3 in Figure
\ref{fig:schematic}A). Units that coded different cue features
(identity, outcome, location) exhibited different temporal profiles as
a whole, although across all recorded units a tiling of task structure
was observed such that all points within our analyzed task space was
accounted for by the ordered peak firing rates of all
units. Furthermore, this tiling differed between various conditions
with a cue feature, such as light versus sound blocks. We discuss
these observations and their implications below.

{\bf Cue identity:}

Our finding that NAc units can discriminate between different
outcome-predictive stimuli with similar motivational significance
(i.e.\ encodes cue identity) expands upon an extensive rodent
literature examining NAc correlates of conditioned stimuli
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend . Perhaps
the most comparable work in rodents comes from a study that found
distinct coding for an odor when it predicted separate but equally
valued rewards \cite{Cooch2015}. The present work is complementary to
such {\it outcome identity} coding as it shows that NAc units {\it cue
  identity}, both separately and integrated with the reward it
predicts (H2 and H3 in Figure \ref{fig:schematic}A). Similarly,
\citeNP{Setlow2003} paired distinct cues with appetitive or aversive
outcomes, and found separate populations of units that encoded each
cue. Once again, our study was different in asking how distinct cues
encoding the same anticipated outcome are encoded. Such cue identity
encoding suggests that even when the biological relevance of these
stimuli is similar, NAc dissociates their representations at the level
of the single-units. A possible interpretation of this coding of cue
features alongside expected outcome is that these representations are
used to associate reward with relevant features of the environment,
so-called credit assignment in the reinforcement learning literature
\cite{sutton1998}. A burgeoning body of human and non-human primate
work has started to elucidated neural correlates of credit assignment
in the PFC, particularly in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Akaishi2016,Asaad2017,Chau2015,Noonan2017}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Chau2015,Akaishi2016,Asaad2017,Noonan2017}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Given the importance
of cortical inputs in NAc associative representations, it is possible
that information related to credit assignment is relayed from the
cortex to NAc \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Cooch2015,Ishikawa2008}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Ishikawa2008,Cooch2015}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

A different possible function for cue identity coding is to support
contextual modulation of the motivational relevance of specific
cues. A context can be understood as a particular mapping between
specific cues and their outcomes: for instance, in context 1 cue A but
not cue B is rewarded, whereas in context 2 cue B but not cue A is
rewarded. Successfully implementing such contextual mappings requires
representation of the cue identities. Indeed, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Sleezer2016}
}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeNP{Sleezer2016}
}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend recorded NAc responses during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST),
a common set-shifting task used in both the laboratory and clinic, and
found units that preferred firing to stimuli when a certain rule, or
rule category was currently active. Further support for a
modulation of NAc responses by strategy comes from an fMRI study that
examined BOLD levels during a set-shifting task
\cite{Fitzgerald2014}. In this task, participants learned two sets of
stimulus-outcome contingencies, a visual set and auditory set. During
testing they were presented with both simultaneously, and the stimulus
dimension that was relevant was periodically shifted between the
two. Here, they found that bilateral NAc activity reflected value
representations for the currently relevant stimulus dimension, and not
the irrelevant stimulus. The current finding of separate, but
overlapping, populations of units encoding cue identity and expected
outcome, suggests that the fMRI finding is generated by the combined
activity of several different functional cell types.

Our analyses were designed to eliminate several potential alternative
interpretations to cue identity coding. Because the different cues
were separated into different blocks, units that discriminated between
cue identities could instead be encoding time or other slowly-changing
quantities. We excluded this possible confound by excluding units that
showed a drift in firing between the first and second half within a
block. However, the possiblity remains that instead of or in addition
to stimulus identity, these units encode a preferred context, or even
a macroscale representation of progress through the session. Indeed,
encoding of the current strategy could be an explanation for the
sustained difference in population averaged firing across stimulus
blocks (Figure \ref{fig:pop}), as well as a potential explanation for
the differentially tiling of task structure across blocks in the
current study (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend .

A different potential confound is that between outcome and action
value coding. We discriminated between these possiblities by analzying
error trials, where the rat appraoched reward (left turn) after
presentation of the reward-unavailable cue. Units that were modulated
by the expected outcome of the cue maintained their specific firing
patterns even during error trials, as expected from outcome value
coding but not action value coding. Additionally, NAc signals have
been shown to be modulated by response vigor \cite{McGinty2013}; to
detangle this from our results we included trial length (i.e.\ latency
to arrival at the reward site) as a predictor in our GLMs, and found
units with cue feature correlates independent of trial length.

An overall limitation of the current study is that rats were never
presented with both sets of cues simultaneously, and were not required
to switch strategies between multiple sets of cues. Thus, it is
unknown to what extent the cue identity encoding we observed is
behaviorally relevant, although extrapolating data from other work
\cite{Sleezer2016} suggests that cue identity coding would be
modulated by relevance. NAc core lesions have been shown to impair
shifting between different behavioral strategies \cite{Floresco2006a},
and it is possible that selectively silencing the units that prefer
responding for a given modality or rule would impair performance when
the animal is required to use that information, or artificial
enhancement of those units would cause them to use the rule when it is
the inappropriate strategy.

{\bf Encoding of position:}

Our finding that cue-evoked activity was modulated by cue location is
in alignment with several previous reports
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

inputs from the hippocampus, and the communication of place-reward
information across the two structures suggests that the NAc tracks
locations associated with reward

that the current task was pseudo-random, it is possible that the rats
learned the structure of sequential cue presentation, and the neural
activity could reflect this. However, this is unlikely as including a
‘previous trial’ variable in the analysis did not explain a
significant amount of firing rate variance in response to the cue for
the vast majority of units. In any case, NAc units on the present
task continued to distinguish between different locations, even though
location, and progress through a sequence, were explicitly irrelevant
in predicting reward. We speculate that this persistent coding of
location in NAc may represent a bias in credit assignment, and
associated tendency for rodents to associate motivationally relevant
events with the locations where they occur.

{\bf Implications:}

Maladaptive decision making, as occurs in schizophrenia, addiction,
Parkinson\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{’}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'}\DIFaddend s, among others, can result from dysfunctional RPE and value
signals \cite{Frank2004,Gradin2011,Maia2011}. This view has been
successful in explaining both positive and negative symptoms in
schizophrenia, and deficits in learning from feedback in Parkinson\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{’}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'}\DIFaddend s
\cite{Frank2004,Gradin2011}. However, the effects of RPE and value
updating are contingent upon encoding of preceding action and cue
features, the eligibility trace \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Lee2012,sutton1998}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{sutton1998,Lee2012}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Value
updates can only be performed on these aspects of preceding experience
that are encoded when the update occurs. Therefore, maladaptive
learning and decision making can result from not only aberrant RPEs
but also from altered cue feature encoding. For instance, on this task
the environmental stimulus that signaled the availability of reward
was conveyed by two distinct cues that were presented in four
locations. While in our current study, the location and identity of
the cue did not require any adjustments in the animal’s behavior, we
found coding of these features alongside the expected outcome of the
cue that could be the outcome of credit assignment computations
computed upstream. Identifying neural coding related to an aspect of
credit assignment is important as inappropriate credit assignment
could be a contributor to conditioned fear overgeneralization seen in
disorders with pathological anxiety such as generalized anxiety
disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive
disorder \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

delusions observed in disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{’}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'}\DIFaddend s and
Parkinson\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{’s \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Kapur2003,Corlett2010}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Thus, our results provide a
neural window into the process of credit assignment, such that the
extent and specific manner in which this process fails in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{e.g.\ }\DIFdelend syndromes such as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
etc.\ can be experimentally accessed\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

\DIFdel{We found that the population of recorded units had a relatively
uniform distribution of firing fields within our task space, similar
to what has been reported previously
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Berke2009,Lansink2012,Shidara1998}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Uniquely, we found that this
representation was statistically different across conditions of a cue
features, such as according to whether the rat was currently engaged
in the light or sound block, suggesting that this could be a possible
neural correlate for encoding the currently relevant strategy in the
NAc. It has been previously shown that during progress through a
predictable trial series, units represented state value of cue, and
that single-unit responses allowed the monkey to know how it was
progressing throughout the task \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Shidara1998}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Likewise, the
tiling we saw could be a consequence of upstream cortical or limbic
inputs informing the striatum of the current task rules. Another
possibility is that the NAc not only pays attention to progress
throughout a task within a trial, but also higher-order task
information, like blocks. Furthermore, dopamine levels in the NAc
fluctuate through a trial, and it is possible that the observed tiling
could be a NAc-representation of state value related to this
temporally evolving dopamine signal. Future experiments should monitor
this mapping of task structure during the application of dopamine
antagonists. Finally, the presence of functional correlates not
evident when looking at single-unit responses time-locked to salient
task events emphasizes the need to employ ensemble level analyses
across all aspects of a task.

\DIFdel{In the current study we found that the coding of cue features
persisted after the choice point, during a delay period while the rat
waited at the receptacle for the outcome (H2 in Figure
\ref{fig:schematic}B). Having an enriched representation that includes
details about the environmental context the animal finds itself in
alongside expected outcome, and is maintained online until the outcome
is revealed could be useful for assigning credit of a reward to the
appropriate elements of an environment, to develop an accurate value
function and optimize long term acquisition of reward

for simultaneous coding of outcome and outcome-predictive stimuli at
the time of feedback in the dorsolateral PFC, and that this coding of
stimulus information was strongest before behavioral performance
stabilized \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

. Interestingly, we found coding of cue
identity and location after presentation of the cue, and during a
delay period between nosepoke and outcome, but not after the outcome
was received. The absence of coding during feedback, and that these
recordings were done after behavioral performance had stabilized
suggests the possibility that these NAc representations represent an
integrated value estimate that is the outcome of earlier upstream
credit assignment in cortical inputs. From a motivated behavior
standpoint, the presence of these enriched representations can help
inform action selection involving Pavlovian behaviors such as
conditioned approach \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdel{If these representations function as an eligibility trace, then there
should be a relationship between the content and robustness of these
representations and the degree to which organisms form adaptive
associations between reinforcers and their environment, which could
contribute to the presence of prediction errors in the NAc in those
that learned an experimental task in humans versus those that did not

. In the present experiment, understanding what
information about the environment the NAc is keeping track of when
reward arrives could be useful for potentially determining what
representations are being reinforced. Would be interesting to see if
selectively reward an animal when certain representations are active
(e.g. arm 1), would help shape their assignment of reward to that
arm. Could be useful for altering a maladaptive preference back to a
more adaptive one, as the loss of certain aspects of coding via BLA
and PFC inputs leads to the loss of outcome-predictive activity to
discrete cues in the NAc. Furthermore, non-discriminatory coding in
the NAc could hypothetically be correlated to over-generalization of
situations, in which the animal may not recognize it is in a different
situation and perform actions that are inefficient or maladaptive for
reward procurement.

\DIFdel{A fundamental problem faced by all reinforcement learning agents is
which features to credit and blame for particular outcomes

motivationally relevant outcomes with the cues that predict them
through learning from feedback. Much work has focused on value signals
