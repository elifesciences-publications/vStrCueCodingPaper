\section*{Introduction}

% To do JG: refine (e.g. make more explicit the tie to the schematic), add references

Theories of nucleus accumbens (NAc) function generally agree that this brain structure contributes to motivated behavior, with some emphasizing a role in learning from reward prediction errors (Joel, Doya, Schultz; see also the addiction literature on the effects of drug rewards; Nestler, Kalivas; Carelli) and others a role in the modulation of ongoing behavior through stimuli associated with motivationally relevant outcomes (invigorating, directing; Nicola, Floresco, Salamone). These proposals echo similar ideas on the functions of the neuromodulator dopamine (Schultz, Berridge, Maia/Frank, Cools), with which the NAc is tightly linked functionally as well as anatomically (Haber, Sesack, Takahashi).

Much of our understanding of NAc function comes from studies of how cues that predict motivationally relevant outcomes (e.g. reward) influence behavior and neural activity in the NAc. Task designs that associate such cues with rewarding outcomes provide a convenient access point eliciting conditioned responses such as sign-tracking and goal-tracking (Robinson), pavlovian-instrumental transfer (Balleine) and enhanced response vigor (Niv; McGinty), which tend to be affected by NAc manipulations (Flagel, Balleine, Chang; although not always straightforwardly: Hauber, Chang). Similarly, analysis of reward prediction errors typically proceeds by establishing an association between a cue and subsequent reward, with NAc responses transferring from outcome to the cue with learning (Schultz, Schoenbaum, Carelli). WHAT ABOUT HUMAN WORK

Surprisingly, although substantial work has been done on the coding of outcomes predicted by such cues (e.g. reward value; Hollerman/Schultz, Roesch, Day; reward identity; Cooch), much less is known about how reward-predictive cues themselves are encoded in the NAc (Hayden from primate realm). This is an important issue for at least two reasons. First, in reinforcement learning, motivationally relevant outcomes are typically temporally delayed relative to the cues that predict them. In order to solve the problem of assigning credit (or blame) across such temporal gaps, some trace of preceding activity needs to be maintained (Maia?). Since NAc is a primary target of DA signals interpretable as RPEs, and NAc lesions impair RPEs related to timing, its activity trace will help determine what can be learned when RPEs arrive (Takahashi). 

Second, for ongoing behavior, the relevance of cues typically depends on “context”. In experimental settings, context may include the identity of a preceding cue (occasion setter, Holland, Kesner), spatial or configural arrangements (Good/Honey, Eichenbaum), and unsignaled rules as occurs in set shifting and other cognitive control tasks (CITE). In such situations, the question arises how selective, context-dependent processing of reward-predictive cues is implemented. For instance, is there a “gate” prior to NAc, or are all cues represented in NAc but their current values dynamically updated (FitzGerald; WHAT ARE SOME THEORETICAL POSITIONS ON THIS)? 

Thus, both from a learning and a flexible performance perspective, it is of interest to determine how cue identity is represented in the brain, with NAc of particular interest given its anatomical and functional position at the center of motivational systems. We sought to determine whether cue features signalling identity are represented in the NAc, and if cue identity is represented alongside other motivationally relevant variables, such as cue value (Figure \ref{fig:schematic}). To address this question, we designed an experiment in which multiple, distinct sets of cues predicted the same outcome. We recorded the activity of NAc neurons as rats performed this task.

\section*{Methods}
%Version 2.1

{\bf Subjects:}

Adult male Long-Evans rats (n = 4, Charles River, Saint Constant, QC) were used as subjects. Rats were individually housed with a 12/12-h light-dark cycle, and tested during the light cycle. Rats were food deprived to 85-90\% of their free feeding weight (weight at time of implantation was 440 - 470 g), and water restricted 4-6 hours before testing. All experimental procedures were approved by the the University of Waterloo Animal Care Committee (protocol\# 11-06) and carried out in accordance with Canadian Council for Animal Care (CCAC) guidelines. 

{\bf Overall timeline:}

Each subject was first handled for seven days where they were exposed to the running room, the sucrose solution, and the click of the valves upon approach to the receptacles. They were then shaped to run on the task for seven days where they were restricted to running in the clockwise direction by presenting a physical barrier to running counterclockwise. Rats underwent hyperdrive implantation after showing discrimination of approach behavior for rewarded and unrewarded cues for three consecutive days according to a chi square test. Rats were allowed to recover for a minimum of five days before being retrained on the task, and recording began once performance returned to pre-surgery levels. Upon completion of recording, animals were sacrificed and recording sites were histologically confirmed.

{\bf Behavioral task and training:} 

Rats were trained to run clockwise on an elevated, square-shaped track (100x100 cm) containing four possible reward locations (Figure \ref{fig:task}). Rats initiated a trial by running down the length of an arm, and triggering a photobeam located 24 cm from the start of each arm. Upon trial initiation, a light or sound cue was presented that signaled the presence of absence of a 12\% sucrose water reward (0.1 mL) at the upcoming site. A trial was classified as an approach trial if the rat turned left at the decision point and made a nosepoke at the reward receptacle (40 cm from the decision point), while trials were classified as a skip trial if the rat instead turned right at the decision point and triggered the photobeam to initiate the following trial. There was a 1 second delay between a rewarded nosepoke and subsequent reward delivery. Trial length was determined by measuring the length of time from cue onset until nosepoke (for approach trials), or from cue onset until the start of the following trial (for skip trials). Trials could only be initiated through clockwise progression through the series of arms, and each entry into the subsequent arm on the track counted as a trial. Each day rats were trained in both a light and sound block for 100 trials each. Within a block, one cue signaled reward was available on that trial, while the other signaled reward was not available. Light block cues were a flashing white light, and a constant yellow light. Sound block cues were a 2 kHz sine wave and a 8 kHz sine wave whose amplitude was modulated from 0 to maximum by a 2 Hz sine wave. Reward-cue associations were counterbalanced across rats. Cue presentation was pseudorandomized so that the same cue could not be presented more than twice in a row. Block order within each day was also pseudorandomized, such that the rat could begin a session with the same block for more than two days in a row. Each training or testing day consisted of a 5 minute pre-session period on a pedestal, followed by the first block, then the second block, then a 5 minute post-session period on the pedestal. Accuracy was determined by the proportion of trials a rat approached each cue. Perfect performance would be 100\% approach on “approach” trials (reward available), and 0\% approach on “skip” trials (no reward available). Rats were trained daily until they could distinguish between the rewarded and unrewarded cues for both light and sound blocks for three consecutive days according to a chi-square test, at which point they underwent surgery. Furthermore, we generated linear mixed effects models to investigate the relationships between cue type and our behavioral variables, with cue type as a fixed effect, and the addition of an intercept for rat identity as a random effect. Average proportion of trials approached and trial length for a session were used as response variables. Contribution of cue type to behavior was determined by comparing the full model to a model with cue type removed for each behavioral variable.

Rewarded and unrewarded cues were presented pseudo-randomly, such that not more than two of the same type of cue could be presented in a row. Location of the cue on the track was irrelevant for behavior, all cue locations were equally rewarded and unrewarded.

{\bf Surgery:}

Surgical procedures were as described previously (Malhotra et al., 2015). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, induced with 5\% in medical grade oxygen and maintained at 2\% throughout the surgery (~0.8 L/min). Rats were then chronically implanted with a “hyperdrive” consisting of 16 independently drivable tetrodes, either all 16 targeted for the right NAc (AP +1.4 mm and ML +1.6 mm, relative to bregma; Paxinos and Watson, 2005), or 12 in the right NAc and 4 targeted at the mPFC (AP +3.0 mm and ML +0.6 mm, relative to bregma; only data from NAc tetrodes were analyzed). Following surgery, all animals were given a least five days to recover and lower tetrodes to the target (DV -6.0 mm) before being reintroduced to the behavioral task.

{\bf Data acquisition and preprocessing:}

After recovery, rats were placed back on the task for recording. NAc signals were acquired at 20 kHz with a RHA2132 v0810 preamplifier (Intan) and a KJE-1001/KJD-1000 data acquisition system (Amplipex). Signals were referenced against a tetrode placed in the corpus callosum above the NAc.

Candidate spikes for sorting into putative single units were obtained by band-pass filtering the data between 600-9000 Hz, thresholding and aligning the peaks (UltraMegaSort2k, Hull et al., 2011). Spike waveforms were then clustered with KlustaKwik using energy and the first derivative of energy as features, and manually sorted into units (MClust 3.5, A.D. Redish et al.). Isolated units containing a minimum of 200 spikes within a session were included for subsequent analysis. Units were classified as high firing neurons if they had high tonic firing rates marked by an absence of interspike intervals (ISIs) $>$ 2 s, while medium spiny neurons had a combination of ISIs $>$ 2 s and phasic activity with shorter ISIs (Barnes 2005, Atallah 2014). 

{\bf Data analysis:}

To investigate the contribution of various cue features on NAc firing rates we first determined whether firing rates for a unit were modulated by the onset of a cue by collapsing across all cues and comparing the firing rates for the 1 s preceding cue-onset with the 1 s following cue-onset. Single units were considered to be cue-responsive if a Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing pre- and post-cue firing had a p $<$ .01. (Excluded: ‘the mean firing rate difference between pre- and post-cue onset was within the lower or upper 2.5\% of a shuffled distribution’, as there is redundancy using both, and I did both because I was paranoid about just using one. ). Cue-modulated units were then classified as either increasing or decreasing in response to the cue if the post-cue activity was higher or lower than the pre-cue activity, respectively. 

To determine the relative contribution of various task parameters to firing rate variance for units whose firing was modulated by cue-onset (as in Figures \ref{fig:examples},\ref{fig:GLM}), a forward selection stepwise general linear model (GLM) was fit to each cue-responsive unit. Cue modality, cue location, cue outcome, approach behavior, trial length, trial number, and trial history were used as predictors, and the 1 s post-cue firing rate as the response variable. Units were classified as being modulated by a given task parameter if addition of the parameter significantly improved model fit using deviance as the criterion (p $<$ .01). A comparison of the R-squared value between the final model and the final model minus the predictor of interest was used to determine the amount of firing rate variance explained by the addition of that predictor for a given unit. 

To better visualize responses to cues and enable subsequent population level analyses (as in Figures \ref{fig:examples},\ref{fig:pop},\ref{fig:tiling}), spike trains were convolved with a Gaussian kernel, and peri-event time histograms (PETHs) were generated by taking the average of the convolved spike trains across trials for a given task condition. For analysis of population-level responses for cue features (Figure \ref{fig:pop}), convolved spike trains for all units where cue modality, cue location, or cue outcome explained a significant portion of firing rate variance were z-scored. Within a given cue feature, normalized spike trains were then separated according to the preferred and non-preferred cue condition (e.g. light vs sound block), and averaged across units to generate population-level averages.

To visualize NAc representation of task space within cue conditions, normalized spike trains for all units were ordered by the location of their maximum or minimum firing rate for a specified cue condition (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}). To compare representation of task space across cue conditions for a cue feature, the ordering of units derived for one condition (e.g. light block) was then applied to the normalized spike trains for the other condition (e.g. sound block). 

To identify the responsivity of units to different cue features at the time of a nosepoke into a reward receptacle, the same cue-responsive units from the cue-onset analyses were analyzed at the time of nosepoke using identical analysis techniques (Figures \ref{fig:NP_GLM},\ref{fig:NP_pop},\ref{fig:NP_tiling}).

Given that some of our analyses compare firing rates across time, particularly comparisons across blocks, we sought to exclude units with unstable firing rates that would generate spurious results reflecting a drift in firing rate over time unrelated to our task. To do this we ran a Mann-Whitney U test comparing the cue-evoked firing rates for the first and second half of trials within a block, and excluded units from analysis that showed a significant change for either block.  All analyses were completed in MATLAB R2015a, and the code is available on GitHub.


{\bf Histology:}

Upon completion of the experiment, rats were anesthetized with 5\% isoflurane, then asphyxiated with carbon dioxide. Transcardial perfusions were performed, and brains were fixed and removed. Brains were sliced in 50 um coronal sections and stained with thionin. Slices were visualized under light microscopy, tetrode placement was determined, and electrodes with recording locations in the NAc were analyzed (Figure \ref{fig:histo}).

\subsection*{Behavior}

Rats were trained to discriminate between cues signaling the availability and absence of reward on a square track with four identical arms for two distinct sets of cues. During each session, rats were presented with two behavioral blocks containing different sensory cues in sequential order, a light and a sound block, with each block containing a cue that predicted reward, and a cue that signalled the absence of reward. An example learning curve is seen in Figure \ref{fig:behav}A,B. All four rats learned to discriminate between the rewarded and unrewarded cue for both the light and sound blocks as determined by reaching significance (p $<$ .05) on a daily chi-square test comparing approach behavior for rewarded and unrewarded cues for each block, for at least three consecutive days (range for time to criteria: 22 - 57 days). Maintenance of behavioral performance during recording sessions was assessed using linear mixed effects models for both proportion of trials where the rat approached the receptacle, and trial length. Analyses revealed that cue type had an influence on the likelihood of a rat to make an approach (p $<$ .001), but not for the length of time taken to complete a trial (p $=$ .13)(Figure \ref{fig:behav}C,D).

\subsection*{NAc neurons encode behaviorally relevant and irrelevant cue features}

{\bf General responses to cue:}

We sought to address which parameters of our task were encoded by NAc activity, specifically whether the NAc encodes aspects of motivationally relevant cues not directly tied to reward, such as the identity and location of the cue, and whether this coding is independent or integrated with coding of cue outcome. To do this we recorded a total of 443 units  in the NAc from 4 rats over 57 sessions while they performed on the square track (Table \ref{tbl1}). Units that had less than 200 spikes, or exhibited a drift in firing rate over the course of either block were excluded from further analysis. The activity of 133 (30\%) of these was modulated by the cue, with more units showing a decrease in firing (n = 124) than an increase (n = 47) around the time of cue-onset (Table \ref{tbl2}). Within this group, 32 were classified as HFNs, while 139 were classified as SPNs. To determine whether these cue-evoked responses were modulated by various aspects of the task, we fit a GLM to each cue-modulated unit. Fitting GLMs revealed that a variety of task parameters accounted for a significant portion of firing rate variance in NAc cue-modulated units, with all task parameters except trial history being predictors in 19-38\% of cue-modulated units, and explaining ~4-9\% on average, although there was substantial variability across cells (Figures \ref{fig:examples}, \ref{fig:GLM}, Table \ref{tbl2}). Notably, there were units that discriminated between whether the rat was performing in the light or sound block (n = 37 / 133), which arm the rat was currently on (n = 50 / 133), and whether the rat was engaged in a rewarded or unrewarded trial (n = 34 / 133), suggesting that the NAc independently encodes features of reward-predictive cues separate from expected outcome (Figure \ref{fig:examples}A-F). Furthermore, interactions between multiple cue features appeared as significant predictors of firing rate variance for 9\% cue-modulated units (n = 11 / 133), although this effect was modest (~1-2\% variance explained), suggesting a weak effect for integrated coding across various aspects of a cue (Figure \ref{fig:examples}G,H). Fitting a GLM to all recorded units...*Jimmie finish this* (data not shown).

{\bf Population level responses:}

NAc units do not work in isolation, and some information about the cue may be hidden in single unit responses. To get a sense of how NAc output encoded cue information at the population level, we normalized firing activity for each unit that was modulated by a given cue feature, then generated the cue-onset aligned population average firing rate for each of the cue features (Fig \ref{fig:pop}). This analyses revealed overall that cells that showed an increase upon cue presentation had stronger responses for the preferred cue condition (Figure \ref{fig:pop}A,C,E). Interestingly, units that were classified as decreasing in response to the cue showed a biphasic response at the population level, with a small peak at a time in alignment with entry into the arm, followed by a sustained dip after cue-onset (Figure \ref{fig:pop}B,D,F). Units that were modulated by cue modality showed by a stronger increase in response to the preferred cue modality, as well as a higher tonic firing rate to the preferred cue modality, most notably in units that decreased in firing rate to the cue (Figure \ref{fig:pop}A,B). Units that were modulated by cue location showed a graded response to locations of decreasing preference (Figure \ref{fig:pop}C,D). Additionally, units whom had exhibited a decrease in firing in response to the cue and whose activity was modulated by cue outcome, showed a sustained discriminatory response to rewarded and unrewarded cues that extended beyond cue-onset (Figure \ref{fig:pop}F). Together, these visualizations of the averaged population responses revealed nuanced differences in the way NAc units are modulated by cue conditions across cue features.

{\bf NAc units segment the task:}

Another method to get a sense of how the NAc is behaving at the population level is to analyze NAc unit activity across time, and NAc neurons have been shown to have correlates across an entire task space. To look at the distribution of responses throughout our task space and see if this distribution is modulated by cue features, we z-scored the firing rate of each unit and plotted the normalized firing rates of all units aligned to cue-onset and according to peak firing rate (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}). We did this separately for both the light and sound blocks, and found a nearly uniform distribution of firing fields in task space that was not limited to alignment to the cue (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}A). Furthermore, to see if this population level activity was similar across blocks, we also organized firing during the sound blocks according to the ordering derived from the light blocks. This revealed that while there was some preservation of order, the overall firing was qualitatively different across the two blocks. Additionally, given that the majority of our units showed an inhibitory response to the cue, we also plotted the firing rates according to the lowest time in firing, and again found some maintenance of order, but largely different ordering across the two blocks (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}B). This process was repeated for cue location and cue outcomes, showing that NAc segmentation of the task is qualitatively different across various cue conditions  (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}C-F).

{\bf Encoding of cue features is not limited to cue-onset:}

In order to be useful for learning, a trace of the cue must be maintained until the outcome. Fitting a GLM to the firing rates of cue-modulated units at the time of a nosepoke response showed that a variety of units still discriminated firing according to various cue features, but not other task parameters, showing that NAc activity discriminates various cue conditions well into a trial (Table \ref{tbl3}, Figure \ref{fig:NP_GLM}). Fitting a GLM to all recorded units...*Jimmie finish this* (data not shown). Population level averages for units that increased to cue-onset showed a ramping up of activity that peaked upon nosepoke, whereas units that decreased to cue-onset showed a gradual reduction of firing activity that reached a minimum upon nosepoke (Figure \ref{fig:NP_pop}). Additionally, a peak is seen for preferred cue outcome in decreasing units at 1 second post cue-onset when reward was received, demonstrating an integration of expected and received reward (Figure \ref{fig:NP_pop}F). Furthermore, aligning normalized peak firing rates to nosepoke onset, revealed a clustering of responses around reward receipt for all cue conditions where the rat would have received reward (Figure \ref{fig:NP_tiling}). Alongside this, fitting a GLM to the firing rates of cue-modulated units at the time of reward receipt, revealed 10 units (8\%) where cue outcome accounted for an average of 32\% of firing rate variance (data not shown).

The present study found evidence for coding of multiple identifying features of motivationally relevant stimuli in addition to expected outcome; the sensory modality of the presented cue, as well at its physical location within the track, and that this coding was still present on approach trials when the rat nosepoked. Furthermore, this coding was both independent, and intermixed across cue features and behavioral measures. Coding at the population level revealed qualitatively distinct comparison profiles across cue features, such as cells that encoded cue modality tended to sustain the discriminatory firing outside of cue presentation, while a subset cells that discriminated rewarded from unrewarded cues maintained this discrimination until after reward receipt. Across all recorded cells, a tiling of task structure was observed such that all points within our analyzed task space was accounted for by the ordered peak firing rates of all cells, and this tiling differed between various conditions with a cue feature, such as light versus sound blocks. Cells that discriminated across blocks were not simply due to drifting of the signal across trials, as cells that showed a drift in firing between the first and second half within a block were excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, even though actions were stereotyped during correct trials, such that the rat always turned left at the decision point to approach for reward, and right to skip the receptacle and initiate the next trial, cells that were modulated by the expected value of the cue maintained their specific firing patterns even during error trials where the rat turned left after presentation of the unrewarded cue, suggesting that these signals did not represent action values. Additionally, NAc signals have been shown to be modulated by response vigor, to detangle this from our results we included the trial length as a predictor in our GLMs, and found cells with correlates independent of trial length.

{\bf Cue modality:}  

Our finding that NAc units can discriminate between cues from different sensory modalities expands upon an extensive literature examining neural correlates of conditioned stimuli. Perhaps the most comparable work in rodents comes from a study that found distinct coding for an odor when it predicted separate but equally valued rewards (Cooch). The present work is complementary to this as it shows that NAc cells have representations of identifiable aspects of the cue itself, in addition to the reward it predicts. Another study paired separate cues with appetitive or aversive outcomes, and found separate populations of cells that encode each cue, with many switching selectivity after reversal of the associations between the cues and outcomes, providing evidence that the NAc encodes the biological significance of stimuli. Once again, our study was different as we recorded neural responses to distinct cues encoding the same anticipated outcome, suggesting that even when the biological relevance of these stimuli is similar, the NAc dissociates their representations at the level of the single-unit (Setlow), although this doesn’t explain the difference in population averaged firing rate for the epochs when the cue is not present. Another possibility is that these modality specific cells were encoding the context, rule, or sequence within a session as some cells responded similar for both rewarded and unrewarded cues within a block. This interpretation is in alignment with a recent paper from the primate realm that recorded NAc responses during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), a common set-shifting task used in both the laboratory and clinic, and found cells that preferred firing to stimuli when a certain rule, or rule category was currently active (Sleezer). Indeed, an encoding of the current strategy could be an explanation as to why a sustained difference in population averaged firing was seen across stimulus blocks, as well as a potential explanation for the differentially tiling of task structure across blocks in the current study. Further support for a modulation of NAc responses by strategy comes from an fMRI study that examined BOLD levels during a set-shifting task (FitzGerald et al., 2014). In this task, participants learned two sets of stimuli-reward contingencies, a visual set and auditory set. During testing they were presented with both simultaneously, and the stimulus dimension that was relevant was periodically shifted between the two. Here, they found that bilateral NAc activity reflected value representations of whatever the currently relevant stimulus dimension was, and not the irrelevant stimulus. The current finding of separate, but overlapping, populations of cells encoding cue modality and expected value, suggests that the fMRI finding is generated by the combined activity of several different functional cell types.

A caveat of the current study is that rats were never presented with both sets of cues simultaneously, and thus never had to switch strategies, although extrapolating the data from the primate study, suggests that the activity of the cue modality cells would be modulated by relevance. Keeping along this theme, the current data set is unable to identity precisely what the modality-sensitive neurons were encoding, that is were they tracking representations of stimulus identity, a preferred context, or even a macroscale representation of progress through the session. Furthermore, their relevance for ongoing behavior is also uncertain. NAc core lesions have been shown to impair shifting between different behavioral strategies, and it is possible that selectively silencing the cells that prefer responding for a given modality or rule would impair performance when the animal is required to use that information, or artificial enhancement of those cells would cause them to use the rule when it is the inappropriate strategy.

{\bf Encoding of position:} 

Our finding that cue-evoked activity was modulated by cue location sides with some of the literature (Lavoie, 1994; Tabuchi, 2000; Strait, 2016). An alternative explanation for a pure spatial representation, is that these are task segmentation correlates, keeping track of where in the task the rat is. A previous non-human primate paper has shown that when reward is contingent upon completion of a series of trials, separate populations of NAc neurons signal the start of a schedule, subsequent trials in the schedule, and the first trial in extended schedules (Shidara et al., 1998). This signalling of position within a sequence has been observed in subsequent studies, and it is possible that the our rats were keeping track of which specific arm they were in as part of a sequence of arms, and not just strictly a spatial representation (Mulder, 2004 and 2005; Khamassi et al., 2008; Berke, 2009). Also, given that our task is pseudo-random, it is possible that the rats learned which cue to anticipate, and the neural activity could reflect this. However, this is unlikely as including a ‘previous trial’ variable in the analysis did not explain a significant amount of firing rate variance in response to the cue for the vast majority of cells..

{\bf Mixed selectivity:} 

Several other papers have reported unit profiles that integrate different task-related variables. These papers report integrated coding between expected value and subsequent motor responses, expected value and identity of a reward, and a combination of spatial-, movement-, and reward-related features (Roesch, Lavoie, Cooch). However, our study is the first to show mixed selectivity among identifying features of a cue and expected outcome or behavior. The presence of mixed selectivity responses confers a larger number of input-output relationships that are available to a given neuron. A possible functional consequence of this attribute of NAc units, is the combination and transformation of various motivationally relevant features into a signal informing downstream decoders such as the ventral pallidum about appropriate behaviors in obtaining motivationally relevant goals and biasing action selection towards these behaviors. 

Mixed selectivity in the NAc could be a consequence of synaptic integration from a variety of anatomically distinct inputs, as seen in experiments examining the convergence of various NAc afferents at the level of synaptic transmission and stimulation-induced firing (Goto and Grace 2008). In one such experiment it was shown that NAc cells that responded to stimulation of either the fornix, amygdala, or PFC, typically responded to stimulation from all inputs (O’Donnell and Grace, 1995). Furthermore, an interaction between these inputs was observed such that PFC stimulation failed to elicit spiking in the NAc neurons unless they were in a depolarized UP-state, a state induced by hippocampal stimulation and was dependent on an intact fornix. Hippocampal-induced suppression of other inputs has also been observed for the BLA (Mulder et al., 1998). Recently, it has also been shown that train stimulation of PFC afferents reduces hippocampal-evoked NAc responses, suggesting that there is competition between various inputs (Calhoon and O’Donnell, 2013). These studies suggest that the integration of the variables we saw could be the result of this gating observed in behaviorally-independent preparations. However, given that we did not systematically manipulate these various limbic and cortical afferents, comments on the anatomical origins of the observed mixed selectivity responses are speculative at this point.

Integrating cue identity and value, as seen modestly in the present study, could be one neural instantiation of how value is associated with the appropriate predictive stimuli (credit assignment), keeping in mind that value encoding is distributed, redundantly in some aspects, across various structures (Hayden Nat Neuro opinion). Indeed, lesions of the NAc impair the ability to learn changes in reward value or identity in an unblocking experiment, as well as disrupting dopamine RPEs generated by modification of timing of reward (McDannald 2011, Takahashi 2016). Would be interesting to see if uncoupling the integrated coding of stimulus features and predictive properties of a cue has an effect on the ability of a rat to use reward-predictive cues to pursue the associated reward.

{\bf Tiling of task structure:}

Additionally, we found that the population of recorded units had a relatively uniform distribution of firing fields within our task space, similar to what has been reported previously (Shidara, 1998; Berke, 2009; Lansink, 2012). Uniquely, we found that this representation differed according to whether the rat was currently engaged in the light or sound block, suggesting that this could be a possible neural correlate for encoding the currently relevant strategy in the NAc. It has been previously shown that during progress through a predictable trial series, neurons represented state value of cue (Shidara 1998), and that single-unit responses allowed the monkey to know how it was progressing throughout the task. Likewise, the tiling we saw could be a consequence of upstream cortical or limbic inputs informing the striatum of the current task rules. Another possibility is that the NAc not only pays attention to progress throughout a task within a trial, but also higher-order task information, like blocks. Furthermore, dopamine levels in the NAc fluctuate through a trial, and it is possible that the observed tiling could be a NAc-representation of state value related to this temporally evolving dopamine signal. Future experiments should monitor this mapping of task structure during the application of dopamine antagonists. Finally, the presence of functional correlates not evident when looking at single-unit responses time-locked to salient task events emphasizes the need to employ ensemble level analyses across all aspects of a task.
