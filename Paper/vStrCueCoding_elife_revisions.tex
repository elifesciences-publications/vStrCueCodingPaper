\section*{Abstract}

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is important for learning from feedback
and for biasing and invigorating behavior in response to cues that
predict motivationally relevant outcomes. NAc encodes outcome-related
cue features such as the magnitude and identity of reward. However,
little is known about how features of cues themselves are encoded.
We designed a decision making task where rats learned multiple sets of
outcome-predictive cues, and recorded single-unit activity in the NAc
during performance. We found that coding of various cue features
occurred alongside coding of expected outcome. Furthermore, this
coding persisted both during a delay period, after the rat made a
decision and was waiting for an outcome, and after the outcome was
revealed. Encoding of cue features in the NAc may enable contextual
modulation of ongoing behavior, and provide an eligibility trace of
outcome-predictive stimuli for updating stimulus-outcome associations
to inform future behavior.

\section*{Introduction}

Theories of nucleus accumbens (NAc) function generally agree that this
brain structure contributes to motivated behavior, with some
emphasizing a role in learning from reward prediction errors (RPEs)
(\citeNP{Joel2002,Maia2009,Khamassi2012,Lee2012,Schultz2016,Averbeck2017};
see also the addiction literature on effects of drug rewards;
\citeNP{Kalivas2005,Hyman2006,Carelli2009}) and others a role in the
modulation of ongoing behavior through stimuli associated with
motivationally relevant outcomes \cite[invigorating,
  directing;][]{Nicola2010a,Salamone2012,Floresco2015}. These
proposals echo similar ideas on the functions of the neuromodulator
dopamine \cite{Maia2009,Berridge2012,Salamone2012,Schultz2016}, with
which the NAc is tightly linked functionally as well as anatomically
\cite{Cheer2007,Ikemoto2007,DuHoffmann2014,Takahashi2016}.

Much of our understanding of NAc function comes from studies of how
cues that predict motivationally relevant outcomes (e.g.\ reward)
influence behavior and neural activity in the NAc. Task designs that
associate such cues with rewarding outcomes provide a convenient
access point eliciting conditioned responses such as sign-tracking and
goal-tracking \cite{hearst1974sign,Robinson2009},
pavlovian-instrumental transfer \cite{Estes1943,Rescorla1967} and
enhanced response vigor \cite{Niv2007,Nicola2010a}, which tend to be
affected by NAc manipulations
(\citeNP{Corbit2011,Flagel2011,Chang2012}; although not always
straightforwardly; \citeNP{Giertler2004,Chang2013}). Similarly,
analysis of RPEs typically proceeds by establishing an association
between a cue and subsequent reward, with NAc responses transferring
from outcome to the cue with learning
\cite{Schultz1997,Setlow2003,Roitman2005,Day2007a}.

Surprisingly, although substantial work has been done on the coding of
outcomes predicted by such cues
\cite{Schultz1992,Hollerman1998,Hassani2001,Cromwell2003,Setlow2003,Nicola2004,Roitman2005,Day2006,Roesch2009a,Saddoris2011,Goldstein2012,Lansink2012,Bissonette2013,McGinty2013,Atallah2014,Sugam2014,Cooch2015,West2016},
much less is known about how outcome-predictive cues themselves are
encoded in the NAc \cite[but see;][]{Sleezer2016}. This is an
important issue for at least two reasons. First, in reinforcement
learning, motivationally relevant outcomes are typically temporally
delayed relative to the cues that predict them. In order to solve the
problem of assigning credit (or blame) across such temporal gaps, some
trace of preceding activity needs to be maintained
\cite{sutton1998,Lee2012}. For example, if you become ill after eating
food X in restaurant A, depending on if you remember the identity of
the restaurant or the food at the time of illness, you may learn to
avoid all restaurants, restaurant A only, food X only, or the specific
pairing of X-in-A. Therefore, a complete understanding of what is
learned following feedback requires understanding what “trace” is
maintained. Since NAc is a primary target of DA signals interpretable
as RPEs, and NAc lesions impair RPEs related to timing, its activity
trace will help determine what can be learned when RPEs arrive
\cite{Ikemoto2007,McDannald2011,Hart2014,Hamid2016,Takahashi2016}. Similarly,
in a neuroeconomics framework, NAc is thought to represent a
domain-general subjective value associated with different offers
\cite{Peters2009,Levy2012,Bartra2013,Sescousse2015}; representation of
the offer itself would provide a potential means for updating offer
value.

Second, for ongoing behavior, the relevance of cues typically depends
on “context”. In experimental settings, context may include the
identity of a preceding cue, spatial or configural arrangements
\cite{Holland1992,Bouton1993,Honey2014}, and unsignaled rules as
occurs in set shifting and other cognitive control tasks
\cite{Grant1948,cohen1992context,Floresco2006a,Sleezer2016}. In such
situations, the question arises how selective, context-dependent
processing of outcome-predictive cues is implemented. For instance, is
there a “gate” prior to NAc such that only currently relevant cues are
encoded in NAc, or are all cues represented in NAc but their current
values dynamically updated
\cite{Goto2008,Fitzgerald2014,Sleezer2016}. Representation of cue
identity would allow for context-dependent mapping of outcomes
predicted by specific cues.

Thus, both from a learning and a flexible performance perspective, it
is of interest to determine how cue identity is represented in the
brain, with NAc of particular interest given its anatomical and
functional position at the center of motivational systems. We sought
to determine whether cue identity is represented in the NAc, if cue
identity is represented alongside other motivationally relevant
variables, such as cue value, and if these representations are
maintained after a behavioral decision has been made (Figure
\ref{fig:schematic}). To address these questions, we recorded the
activity of NAc units as rats performed a task in which multiple,
distinct sets of cues predicted the same outcome.

Right panel: Identity and outcome coding (A: right panel), or identity coding at cue-onset and nosepoke (B: right panel) are represented by overlapping populations of units, shown here by the purple circles. The absence of a correlation (r $\sim$ 0) suggests that the overlap of identity and outcome coding, or cue-onset and nosepoke coding, is expected by chance and that the two cue features, or points in time, are coded independently from one another. A positive correlation (r $>$ 0) implies a higher overlap than expected by chance, suggesting joint coding. Note: The same hypotheses apply to other aspects of the environment when the cue is presented, such as the physical location of the cue, as well as other time epochs within the task, such as when the animal receives feedback about an approach.}

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Behavior}

Rats were trained to discriminate between cues signaling the
availability and absence of reward on a square track with four
identical arms for two distinct set of cues (Figure
\ref{fig:task}). During each session, rats were presented sequentially
with two behavioral blocks containing cues from different sensory
modalities, a light and a sound block, with each block containing a
cue that signalled the availability of reward (reward-available), and
a cue that signalled the absence of reward (reward-unavailable). To
maximize reward receipt, rats should approach reward sites on
reward-available trials, and skip reward sites on reward-unavailable
trials (see Figure \ref{fig:behav}A for an example learning
curve). All four rats learned to discriminate between the
reward-available and reward-unavailable cues for both the light and
sound blocks as determined by reaching significance ($p <$ .05) on a
daily chi-square test comparing approach behavior for reward-available
and reward-unavailable cues for each block, for at least three
consecutive days (range for time to criterion: 22 - 57
days). Maintenance of behavioral performance during recording sessions
was assessed using linear mixed effects models for both proportion of
trials where the rat approached the receptacle, and trial
length. Analyses revealed that the likelihood of a rat to make an
approach was influenced by whether a reward-available or
reward-unavailable cue was presented, but was not significantly
modulated by whether the rat was presented with a light or sound cue
(Percentage approached: light reward-available = 97\%; light
reward-unavailable = 34\%; sound reward-available = 91\%; sound
reward-unavailable 35\%; cue identity p $=$ .115; cue outcome p$<$
.001; Figure \ref{fig:behav}B). A similar trend was seen with the
length of time taken to complete a trial (Trial length: light
reward-available = 1.85 s; light reward-unavailable = 1.74 s; sound
reward-available = 1.91 s; sound reward-unavailable 1.78 s; cue
identity p $=$ .106; cue outcome p $<$ .001; Figure
\ref{fig:behav}C). Thus, during recording, rats successfully
discriminated the cues according to whether or not they signaled the
availability of reward at the reward receptacle.

  not more than two of the same type of cue could be presented in a
  row. Location of the cue on the track was irrelevant for behavior,
  all cue locations contained an equal amount of reward-available and
  reward-unavailable trials.}

\subsection*{NAc encodes behaviorally relevant and irrelevant cue features}

We sought to address which parameters of our task were encoded by NAc
activity, specifically whether the NAc encodes aspects of
motivationally relevant cues not directly tied to reward, such as the
identity and location of the cue, and whether this coding is
accomplished by separate or overlapping populations (Figure
\ref{fig:schematic}A). To do this we recorded a total of 443 units
with $>$ 200 spikes in the NAc from 4 rats over 57 sessions (range: 12
- 18 sessions per rat) while they performed a cue discrimination task
(Table \ref{tbl1}). Units that exhibited a drift in firing rate over
the course of either block, as measured by a Mann-Whitney U comparing
firing rates for the first and second half of trials within a block,
were excluded from further analysis, leaving 344 units for further
analysis. The activity of 133 (39\%) of these 344 units were modulated
by the cue, with more showing a decrease in firing (n = 103) than an
increase (n = 30) around the time of cue-onset (Table
\ref{tbl1}). Within this group, 24 were classified as FSIs, while 109
were classified as SPNs. Upon visual inspection, we observed several
patterns of firing activity, including units that discriminated firing
upon cue-onset across various cue conditions, showed sustained
differences in firing across cue conditions, had transient responses
to the cue, showed a ramping of activity starting at cue-onset, and
showed elevated activity immediately preceding cue-onset (Figure
\ref{fig:examples}).

To characterize more formally whether these cue-evoked responses were
modulated by various aspects of the task, we fit a forward selection
stepwise generalized linear model (GLM) to each cue-modulated
unit for 1 second post cue-onset. Fitting GLMs to all trials within a session revealed that a
variety of task parameters accounted for a significant portion of
firing rate variance in NAc cue-modulated units (Figure \ref{fig:Q1}A-B,\ref{fig:Q1SUPP1},
Table \ref{tbl1}). Notably, there were units that discriminated
between the light or sound block (28\% of cue-modulated units,
accounting for 6\% of variance on average), between arms of the maze
(38\% of cue-modulated units, accounting for 6\% of variance on
average), and between the common portion of reward-available or
reward-unavailable trials (26\% of cue-modulated units, accounting for
4\% of variance on average), suggesting that the NAc encodes features
of reward-predictive cues in addition to expected outcome (Figure
\ref{fig:examples},\ref{fig:examplesSUPP1},\ref{fig:examplesSUPP2},\ref{fig:scat}). \bsf{UPDATE SECTION: To
determine whether overlap of coding of cue features was different than
expected by chance we correlated recoded beta coefficients from the
GLMs (Figure \ref{fig:Q1}D). This revealed that cue identity was
coded independently from both cue outcome (r $=$ -.018; p $=$ .840)
and cue location (r $=$ .107; p $=$ .220), as determined by
non-significant correlations, but that cue location and cue outcome
were encoded jointly (r $=$ .221; p $=$ .011), as signified by a
significant positive correlation. Chi-square tests depicted a similar
pattern of results (cue identity and cue location = $\chi =$ .687, p
$=$ .407; cue identity and cue outcome = $\chi =$ .022, p $=$ .882;
cue location and cue outcome = $\chi =$ 3.02, p $=$ .082).} The GLM
fitting was repeated for the first half of the trials in each stimulus
block. This revealed a qualitatively similar pattern of results,
suggesting that this selectivity is present early within a block
(first half of block vs. all trials: 37 vs. 37, 45 vs. 50, and 25
vs. 34 units for cue identity, cue location, and cue outcome,
respectively). To control for differences that may have arisen do to
different behavior at the choice point, we also analyzed our data for
approach trials only. Comparison of the GLMs using only approach
trials versus all trials was qualitatively similar (approach trials
vs. all trials: 33 vs. 37, 45 vs. 50, and 28 vs. 34 units for cue
identity, cue location, and cue outcome, respectively).  Additionally,
a sliding window GLM centered on cue-onset revealed that cue identity
and cue location contributed to the activity of a significant
proportion of cue-modulated units throughout this epoch, whereas an
increase in units encoding cue outcome became apparent after cue-onset
(z-score $>1.96$ when comparing proportion of units to that observed
when shuffling the firing rates before running the GLM, Figure
\ref{fig:Q1}D). Together, these findings show that various cue
features are represented in the NAc in overlapping populations, that
cue modality is coded independently from cue outcome and cue location,
and that cue outcome and cue location are coded jointly (Figure
\ref{fig:schematic}).

To assess what information may be encoded at the population level, we
trained a classifier on a pseudoensemble of the 133 cue-modulated
units (Figure \ref{fig:LDA}). Specifically, we used the firing rate
across units for each trial as an observation, and different cue
features as trial labels (cue identity, outcome, and location). A
linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier with 10-fold
cross-validation could correctly predict a trial above chance levels
for all cue features for most time epochs (z-score $>$ 1.96 when
comparing classification accuracy of data versus shuffling the firing
rates). Notably, the ability to predict whether a trial was
reward-available or reward-unavailable (cue outcome) was low pre-cue
and increased as a trial progressed (Figure \ref{fig:LDA}A).

{\bf NAc units dynamically segment the task:}

Next, we sought to determine how coding of cue features evolved over
time. Two main possibilities can be distinguished (Figure 1, bottom),
a unit coding for a feature such as cue outcome could remain
persistently active, or a progression of distinct units could activate
in sequence. To visualize the distribution of responses throughout our
task space and test if this distribution is modulated by cue features,
we z-scored the firing rate of each unit and plotted the normalized
firing rates of all units aligned to cue-onset and sorted them
according to the time of peak firing rate (Figure
\ref{fig:tiling}). We did this separately for both the light and sound
blocks, and found a nearly uniform distribution of firing fields in
task space that was not limited to alignment to the cue (Figure
\ref{fig:tiling}A). Furthermore, to determine if this population level
activity was similar across blocks, we also organized firing during
the sound blocks according to the ordering derived from the light
blocks. This revealed that while there was some preservation of order,
the overall firing was qualitatively different across the two blocks,
implying that population activity distinguishes between light and
sound blocks. To control for the possibility that any comparison of
trials would produce this effect, we did a within block comparison,
comparing half of the trials in the light block against the other
half. This comparison looked similar to our test comparison of sound
block trials ordered by light block trials. Additionally, given that
the majority of our units showed an inhibitory response to the cue, we
also plotted the firing rates according to the lowest time in firing,
and again found some maintenance of order, but largely different
ordering across the two blocks, and the within block comparison
(Figure \ref{fig:tiling}D). To further test this, we divided each
block into two halves and looked at the correlation of the average
smoothed firing rates across various combinations of these halves
across our cue-aligned centered epoch. A linear mixed effects model
revealed that within block correlations (e.g. one half of light trials
vs other half of light trials) were higher and more similar than
across block correlations (e.g. half of light trials vs half of sound
trials) suggesting that activity in the NAc discriminates across
various cue conditions (within block correlations = .383 (light), .379
(sound); across block correlations = .343, .338, .337, .348; within
block vs.\ within block comparison = p $=$ .934; within block
vs.\ across block comparisons = p $<$ .001). This process was repeated
for cue location (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}B,E; within block
correlations = .369 (arm 1), .350 (arm 2); across block correlations =
.290, .286, .285, .291; within block vs.\ within block comparison = p
$=$ .071; within block vs.\ across block comparisons = p $<$ .001) and
cue outcome (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}C,F; within block correlations =
.429 (reward-available), .261 (reward-unavailable); across block
correlations = .258, .253, .255, .249; within block vs.\ within block
comparison = p $<$ .001; within block vs.\ across block comparisons =
p $<$ .001), showing that NAc segmentation of the task is
qualitatively different even during those parts of the task not
immediately associated with a specific cue, action, or outcome,
although the within condition comparison of reward-unavailable trials
was less correlated than reward-available trials, and more similar to
the across condition comparisons, potentially due do the greater
behavioral variability for the reward-unavailable trials.

produces this partial similarity, however correlations within blocks are more
similar than correlations across blocks (see text). \bsf{B}: Same layout as in

a similar pattern. \bsf{C}: Same layout as in A, except that panels now

{\bf NAc encoding of cue features persists until outcome:}

In order to be useful for credit assignment in reinforcement learning, a trace of the cue must be maintained until the outcome, so that information about the outcome can be associated with the outcome-predictive cue. To test whether representations of cue features persisted post-approach until the outcome was revealed, we fit a GLM to the post-approach firing rates of cue-modulated units aligned to the time of nosepoke into the reward receptacle. This analysis
showed that a variety of units still discriminated firing according to various cue features, but not other task parameters, showing that NAc activity discriminates various cue conditions well into a trial (Table \ref{tbl1}, Figures \ref{fig:NP_examples},\ref{fig:NP_examplesSUPP1},\ref{fig:NP_examplesSUPP2},\ref{fig:NP_GLM}). Additionally, these units were a mix between most of the units that encoded cue features at cue-onset (r $=$ .386, .781, .758, across cue-onset and nosepoke for cue identity, cue location, and cue outcome, respectively, all p values $<$ .001), and those that did not previously have a cue feature as a predictor (29, 48, and 30 out of 133 cue-modulated units encoded both time points for cue identity, cue location, and cue outcome, respectively). Chi-square tests confirmed these results (cue identity =  $\chi =$ 6.165, p $=$ .013; cue location = $\chi =$ 21.670, p $<$ .001; cue outcome = $\chi =$ 34.560, p $<$ .001). Population level averages for units that increased to cue-onset showed a ramping up of activity that peaked upon nosepoke, whereas units that decreased to cue-onset showed a gradual reduction of firing activity that reached a minimum upon nosepoke (Figure \ref{fig:NP_pop}). Additionally, a peak is seen for preferred cue outcome in decreasing units at 1 second post cue-onset when reward was received, demonstrating an integration of expected and received reward (Figure \ref{fig:NP_pop}F). 

Aligning normalized peak firing rates to nosepoke onset revealed a clustering of responses around outcome receipt for all cue conditions where the rat would have received reward (Figure \ref{fig:NP_tiling}), in addition to the same trend of higher within- vs across-block correlations for cue identity (Figure \ref{fig:NP_tiling}A,C; within block correlations = .560 (light), .541 (sound); across block correlations = .487, .481, .483, .486; within block vs. within block comparison = p $=$ .112; within block vs. across block comparisons = p $<$ .001) and cue location (Figure \ref{fig:NP_tiling}B,E; within block correlations = .474 (arm 1), .461 (arm 2); across block correlations = .416, .402, .416, .415; within block vs. within block comparison = p $=$ .810; within block vs. across block comparisons = p $<$ .001), but not cue outcome (Figure \ref{fig:NP_tiling}C,F; within block correlations = .620 (reward-available), .401 (reward-unavailable); across block correlations = .418, .414, .390, .408; within block vs. within block comparison = p $<$ .001; within block vs. across block comparisons = p $<$ .001). 

To determine whether coding of cue features persisted after the outcome was revealed, a GLM was fit to the firing rates of cue-modulated units at the time of outcome receipt, during which the cue was still present. Fitting a GLM revealed 10 units (8\%) where cue outcome accounted for an average of 32\% of firing rate variance (Table \ref{tbl1}, data not shown). An absence of cue identity or cue location coding at this level of analysis was observed, but looking at the data more closely with a sliding window GLM revealed that cue identity, cue location, and cue outcome were encoded throughout time epochs surround cue-onset, nosepoke hold, and outcome receipt, suggesting that the NAc maintains a representation of these cue features once the rat receives behavioral feedback for its decision (Figure \ref{fig:NP_GLM}E-J).

\section*{Discussion}

The main result of the present study is that NAc units encode not only
the expected outcome of outcome-predictive cues, but also the identity
of such cues (Figure \ref{fig:schematic}A). Importantly, this identity coding was maintained on
approach trials both during a delay period where the rat held a
nosepoke until the outcome was received, and immediately after outcome
receipt (Figure \ref{fig:schematic}B). The population of units that
coded for cue identity was statistically independent from the
population coding for expected outcome (i.e.\ overlap as expected from
chance, Figure \ref{fig:schematic}C). This information was also present at the population level, with a higher than chance classification accuracy for predicting the right cue condition using a pseudoensemble. Units that coded different cue
features (identity, outcome, location) exhibited different temporal
profiles as a whole, although across all recorded units a tiling of
task structure was observed such that all points within our analyzed
task space was accounted for by the ordered peak firing rates of all
units. Furthermore, this tiling differed between various conditions
with a cue feature, such as light versus sound blocks. We discuss
these observations and their implications below.

{\bf Cue identity:}

Our finding that NAc units can discriminate between different
outcome-predictive stimuli with similar motivational significance
(i.e.\ encodes cue identity) expands upon an extensive rodent
literature examining NAc correlates of conditioned stimuli
\cite{Setlow2003,Nicola2004,Yun2004,Roitman2005,Day2006,Ambroggi2008,Ishikawa2008,Roesch2009a,Saddoris2011,Goldstein2012,Lansink2012,Bissonette2013,McGinty2013,Atallah2014,Sugam2014,Cooch2015,West2016,Dejean2017}. Perhaps
the most comparable work in rodents comes from a study that found
distinct coding for an odor when it predicted separate but equally
valued rewards \cite{Cooch2015}. The present work is complementary to
such {\it outcome identity} coding as it shows that NAc units encode
{\it cue identity}, in addition to the reward it predicts (Figure
\ref{fig:schematic}A). Similarly, \citeauthor{Setlow2003} (2003)
paired distinct odor cues with appetitive or aversive outcomes, and
found separate populations of units that encoded each
cue. Furthermore, during a reversal they found that the majority of
units switched their selectivity, arguing that the NAc units were
tracking the motivational significance of these stimuli. Once again,
our study was different in asking how distinct cues encoding the same
anticipated outcome are encoded. Such cue identity encoding suggests
that even when the motivational significance of these stimuli is
identical, NAc dissociates their representations at the level of the
single-units. A possible interpretation of this coding of cue
features alongside expected outcome is that these representations are
used to associate reward with relevant features of the environment,
so-called credit assignment in the reinforcement learning literature
\cite{sutton1998}. A burgeoning body of human and non-human primate
work has started to elucidated neural correlates of credit assignment
in the PFC, particularly in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex
\cite{Chau2015,Akaishi2016,Asaad2017,Noonan2017}. Given the importance
of cortical inputs in NAc associative representations, it is possible
that information related to credit assignment is relayed from the
cortex to NAc \cite{Ishikawa2008,Cooch2015}.

Viewed within the neuroeconomic framework of decision making,
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have found
support for NAc representations of {\it offer value}, a domain-general
common currency signal that enables comparison of different attributes
such as reward identity, effort, and temporal proximity
\cite{Peters2009,Levy2012,Bartra2013,Sescousse2015}. Our study adds to
a growing body of electrophysiological research that suggests the view
of the NAc as a value center, while informative and capturing major
aspects of NAc processing, neglects additional contributions of NAc to
learning and decision making such as the offer (cue) identity signal
reported here.

A different possible function for cue identity coding is to support
contextual modulation of the motivational relevance of specific
cues. A context can be understood as a particular mapping between
specific cues and their outcomes: for instance, in context 1 cue A but
not cue B is rewarded, whereas in context 2 cue B but not cue A is
rewarded. Successfully implementing such contextual mappings requires
representation of the cue identities. Indeed, \citeauthor{Sleezer2016} (2016)
recorded NAc responses during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task,
a common set-shifting task used in both the laboratory and clinic, and
found units that preferred firing to stimuli when a certain rule, or
rule category was currently active. Further support for a
modulation of NAc responses by strategy comes from an fMRI study that
examined BOLD levels during a set-shifting task
\cite{Fitzgerald2014}. In this task, participants learned two sets of
stimulus-outcome contingencies, a visual set and an auditory set. During
testing they were presented with both simultaneously, and the stimulus
dimension that was relevant was periodically shifted between the
two. Here, they found that bilateral NAc activity reflected value
representations for the currently relevant stimulus dimension, and not
the irrelevant stimulus. The current finding of independent coding of cue identity and expected
outcome, suggests that the fMRI finding is generated by the combined
activity of several different functional cell types.

Our analyses were designed to eliminate several potential alternative
interpretations to cue identity coding. Because the different cues
were separated into different blocks, units that discriminated between
cue identities could instead be encoding time or other slowly-changing
quantities. We excluded this possible confound by excluding units that
showed a drift in firing between the first and second half within a
block. However, the possiblity remains that instead of or in addition
to stimulus identity, these units encode a preferred context, or even
a macroscale representation of progress through the session. Indeed,
encoding of the current strategy could be an explanation for the
sustained difference in population averaged firing across stimulus
blocks (Figure \ref{fig:pop}), as well as a potential explanation for
the differentially tiling of task structure across blocks in the
current study (Figure \ref{fig:tiling}).

A different potential confound is that between outcome and action
value coding as the rat was only rewarded for left turns. Our GLM
analysis dealt with this by excluding firing rate variance accounted
for by a predictor that represented whether the animal approached
(left turn) or skipped (right turn) the reward port at the choice
point, thus we were able to identity units that were modulated by the
expected outcome of the cue after removing variance for potential
action value coding. Additionally, NAc signals have been shown to be
modulated by response vigor \cite{McGinty2013}; to detangle this from
our results we included trial length (i.e.\ latency to arrival at the
reward site) as a predictor in our GLMs, and found units with cue
feature correlates independent of trial length.

An overall limitation of the current study is that rats were never
presented with both sets of cues simultaneously, and were not required
to switch strategies between multiple sets of cues (in behavioral
pilots, animals took several days of training to successfully switch
strategies). Additionally, our recordings were done during performance
on the well-learned behavior, and not during the initial acquisition
of the cue-outcome relationships when an eligibility trace would be
most useful. Thus, it is unknown to what extent the cue identity
encoding we observed is behaviorally relevant, although extrapolating
data from other work \cite{Sleezer2016} suggests that cue identity
coding would be modulated by relevance. NAc core lesions have been
shown to impair shifting between different behavioral strategies
\cite{Floresco2006a}, and it is possible that selectively silencing
the units that prefer responding for a given modality or rule would
impair performance when the animal is required to use that
information, or artificial enhancement of those units would cause them
to use the rule when it is the inappropriate strategy.

{\bf Encoding of position:}

Our finding that cue-evoked activity was modulated by cue location is
in alignment with several previous reports
\cite{Lavoie1994,Wiener2003,Mulder2005,Strait2016}. The NAc receives
inputs from the hippocampus, and the communication of place-reward
information across the two structures suggests that the NAc tracks
locations associated with reward
\cite{Tabuchi2000,Pennartz2004,Lansink2008,Lansink2009,VanderMeer2011,Lansink2016,Sjulson2017}. However,
it is notable that in our task, location is explicitly uninformative
about reward, yet coding of this uninformative variable persists. The
tiling of task space is in alignment with previous studies showing
that NAc units can also signal progress through a sequence of cues
and/or actions
\cite{Shidara1998,Mulder2004,Khamassi2008,Berke2009,Lansink2012,Atallah2014},
is similar to observations in the basal forebrain \cite{Tingley2018}, and
may represent a temporally evolved state value signal
\cite{Pennartz2011,Hamid2016}. Given that the current task was
pseudo-random, it is possible that the rats learned the structure of
sequential cue presentation, and the neural activity could reflect
this. However, this is unlikely as including a ‘previous trial’
variable in the analysis did not explain a significant amount of
firing rate variance in response to the cue for the vast majority of
units. In any case, NAc units on the present task continued to
distinguish between different locations, even though location, and
progress through a sequence, were explicitly irrelevant in predicting
reward. We speculate that this persistent coding of location in NAc
may represent a bias in credit assignment, and associated tendency for
rodents to associate motivationally relevant events with the locations
where they occur.

{\bf Implications:}

Maladaptive decision making, as occurs in schizophrenia, addiction,
Parkinson's, among others, can result from dysfunctional RPE and value
signals \cite{Frank2004,Gradin2011,Maia2011}. This view has been
successful in explaining both positive and negative symptoms in
schizophrenia, and deficits in learning from feedback in Parkinson's
\cite{Frank2004,Gradin2011}. However, the effects of RPE and value
updating are contingent upon encoding of preceding action and cue
features, the eligibility trace \cite{sutton1998,Lee2012}. Value
updates can only be performed on these aspects of preceding experience
that are encoded when the update occurs. Therefore, maladaptive
learning and decision making can result from not only aberrant RPEs
but also from altered cue feature encoding. For instance, on this task
the environmental stimulus that signaled the availability of reward
was conveyed by two distinct cues that were presented in four
locations. While in our current study, the location and identity of
the cue did not require any adjustments in the animal’s behavior, we
found coding of these features alongside the expected outcome of the
cue that could be the outcome of credit assignment computations
computed upstream. Identifying neural coding related to an aspect of
credit assignment is important as inappropriate credit assignment
could be a contributor to conditioned fear overgeneralization seen in
disorders with pathological anxiety such as generalized anxiety
disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive
disorder \cite{Kaczkurkin2013,Lissek2014,Kaczkurkin2017}, and
delusions observed in disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's \cite{Kapur2003,Corlett2010}. Thus, our results provide a
neural window into the process of credit assignment, such that the
extent and specific manner in which this process fails in syndromes such as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
etc.\ can be experimentally accessed.

\section*{Methods}

{\bf Subjects:}

A sample size of 4 adult male Long-Evans rats (Charles River, Saint Constant, QC) from an apriori determined sample of 5 
were used as subjects (1 rat was excluded from the data set due to poor cell yield). Rats were individually housed with a 12/12-h
light-dark cycle, and tested during the light cycle. Rats were food
deprived to 85-90\% of their free feeding weight (weight at time of
implantation was 440 - 470 g), and water restricted 4-6 hours before
testing. All experimental procedures were approved by the the
University of Waterloo Animal Care Committee (protocol\# 11-06) and
carried out in accordance with Canadian Council for Animal Care (CCAC)
guidelines.

{\bf Overall timeline:}

Each rat was first handled for seven days during which they were
exposed to the experiment room, the sucrose solution used as a
reinforcer, and the click of the sucrose dispenser valves. Rats were
then trained on the behavioral task (described in the next section)
until they reached performance criterion. At this point they
underwent hyperdrive implantation targeted at the NAc. Rats were
allowed to recover for a minimum of five days before being retrained
on the task, and recording began once performance returned to
pre-surgery levels. Upon completion of recording, animals were gliosed,
euthanized and recording sites were histologically confirmed.

{\bf Behavioral task and training:}

The behavioral apparatus was an elevated, square-shaped track (100 x
100 cm, track width 10 cm) containing four possible reward locations
at the end of track ``arms'' (Figure \ref{fig:task}). Rats initiated a
{\it trial} by triggering a photobeam located 24 cm from the start of
each arm. Upon trial initiation, one of two possible light cues (L1,
L2), or one of two possible sound cues (S1, S2), was presented that
signaled the presence ({\it reward-available trial}, L1+, S1+) or
absence ({\it reward-unavailable trial}, L2-, S2-) of a 12\% sucrose
water reward (0.1 mL) at the upcoming reward site. A trial was
classified as an {\it approach trial} if the rat turned left at the
decision point and made a nosepoke at the reward receptacle (40 cm
from the decision point), while trials were classified as a {\it skip
trial} if the rat instead turned right at the decision point and
triggered the photobeam to initiate the next trial. A trial is labeled
{\it correct} if the rat approached (i.e.\ nosepoked) on
reward-available trials, and skipped (i.e.\ did not nosepoke) on
reward-unavailable trials. On reward-available trials there was a 1
second delay between a nosepoke and subsequent reward delivery. {\it
Trial length} was determined by measuring the length of time from
cue-onset until nosepoke (for approach trials), or from cue-onset
until the start of the following trial (for skip trials). Trials could
only be initiated through clockwise progression through the series of
arms, and each entry into the subsequent arm on the track counted as a
trial. Cues were present until 1  second after outcome receipt on approach trials, and until initiating the following trial on skip trials.

Each session consisted of both a {\it light block} and a {\it sound block} with
100 trials each. Within a block, one cue signaled reward was available on that
trial (L1+ or S1+), while the other signaled reward was not available (L2- or
S2-). Light block cues were a flashing white light, and a constant yellow
light. Sound block cues were a 2 kHz sine wave and a 8 kHz sine wave whose
amplitude was modulated from 0 to maximum by a 2 Hz sine wave. Outcome-cue
associations were counterbalanced across rats, e.g.\ for some rats L1+ was the
flashing white light, and for others L1+ was the constant yellow light. The
order of cue presentation was pseudorandomized so that the same cue could not be
presented more than twice in a row. Block order within each day was also
pseudorandomized, such that the rat could not begin a session with the same
block for more than two days in a row. Each session consisted of a 5 minute
pre-session period on a pedestal (a terracotta planter filled with towels),
followed by the first block, then the second block, then a 5 minute post-session
period on the pedestal. For approximately the first week of training, rats were restricted to
running in the clockwise direction by presenting a physical barrier to
running counterclockwise. Cues signaling the availability and
unavailability of reward, as described above, were present from the
start of training. Rats were trained for 200 trials per day (100
trials per block) until they discriminated between the reward-available and reward-unavailable cues for both light and
sound blocks for three consecutive days, according to a chi-square test
rejecting the null hypothesis of equal approaches for reward-available and
reward-unavailable trials, at which point they underwent electrode implant
surgery.

{\bf Surgery:}

Surgical procedures were as described previously
\cite{Malhotra2015}. Briefly, animals were administered analgesics and
antibiotics, anesthetized with isoflurane, induced with 5\% in medical
grade oxygen and maintained at 2\% throughout the surgery (~0.8
L/min). Rats were then chronically implanted with a ``hyperdrive''
consisting of 16 independently drivable tetrodes, either all 16
targeted for the right NAc (AP +1.4 mm and ML +1.6 mm relative to
bregma; \citeNP{atlas}), or 12 in the right NAc and 4 targeted at the
mPFC (AP +3.0 mm and ML +0.6 mm, relative to bregma; only data from
NAc tetrodes was analyzed). Following surgery, all animals were given
at least five days to recover while receiving post-operative care, and
tetrodes were lowered to the target (DV -6.0 mm) before being
reintroduced to the behavioral task.

{\bf Data acquisition and preprocessing:}

After recovery, rats were placed back on the task for recording. NAc
signals were acquired at 20 kHz with a RHA2132 v0810 preamplifier
(Intan) and a KJE-1001/KJD-1000 data acquisition system
(Amplipex). Signals were referenced against a tetrode placed in the
corpus callosum above the NAc. Candidate spikes for sorting into
putative single units were obtained by band-pass filtering the data
between 600-9000 Hz, thresholding and aligning the peaks \cite[UltraMegaSort2k, ][]{Hill2011}. Spike waveforms were then
clustered with KlustaKwik using energy and the first derivative of
energy as features, and manually sorted into units (MClust 3.5,
A.D.\ Redish et al., http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/MClust/MClust.html). Isolated units containing a minimum of 200
spikes within a session were included for subsequent analysis. Units
were classified as fast spiking interneurons (FSIs) by an absence of
interspike intervals (ISIs) $>$ 2 s, while medium spiny neurons (MSNs)
had a combination of ISIs $>$ 2 s and phasic activity with shorter
ISIs \cite{Barnes2005,Atallah2014}.

{\bf Data analysis:}

{\it Behavior.} To determine if rats distinguished behaviorally
between the reward-available and reward-unavailable cues ({\it cue
outcome}), we generated linear mixed effects models to investigate
the relationships between cue type and our behavioral variables, with
{\it cue outcome} (reward available or not) and {\it cue identity}
(light or sound) as fixed effects, and the addition of an intercept
for rat identity as a random effect. For each cue, the average
proportion of trials approached and trial length for a session were
used as response variables. Contribution of cue outcome to behavior
was determined by comparing the full model to a model with cue outcome
removed for each behavioral variable.

{\it Neural data.} Given that some of our analyses compare firing rates across time,
particularly comparisons across blocks, we sought to exclude units
with unstable firing rates that would generate spurious results
reflecting a drift in firing rate over time unrelated to our task. To
do this we ran a Mann-Whitney U test comparing the cue-evoked firing
rates for the first and second half of trials within a block, and
excluded 99 of 443 units from analysis that showed a significant change for
either block, leaving 344 units for further analyses by our GLM. To investigate the contribution of different cue
features ({\it cue identity}, {\it cue location} and {\it cue outcome}) on the firing rates of NAc
single units, we first determined whether firing rates for a unit
were modulated by the onset of a cue by collapsing across all cues
and comparing the firing rates for the 1 s preceding cue-onset with
the 1 s following cue-onset. Single units were considered to be {\it
cue-modulated} if a Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing pre- and
post-cue firing was significant at $p <$ .01. Cue-modulated units
were then classified as either increasing or decreasing if the
post-cue activity was higher or lower than the pre-cue activity,
respectively.

To determine the relative contribution of different task parameters to firing rate variance (as in Figures \ref{fig:examples}-\ref{fig:Q1}), a forward selection stepwise GLM using a Poisson distribution for the response variable was fit to each cue-modulated unit, using data from every trial in a session. Cue identity (light block, sound block), cue location (arm 1, arm 2, arm 3, arm 4), cue outcome (reward-available, reward-unavailable), behavior (approach, skip), trial length, trial number, and trial history (reward availability on the previous 2 trials) were used as predictors, and the 1 s post-cue firing rate as the response variable. Units were classified as being modulated by a
given task parameter if addition of the parameter significantly
improved model fit using deviance as the criterion ($p <$ .01). A
comparison of the R-squared value between the final model and the
final model minus the predictor of interest was used to determine the
amount of firing rate variance explained by the addition of that
predictor for a given unit. To determine the degree to which coding of
cue identity, cue location, and cue outcome overlapped within units we
computed pearson’s r on recoded beta coefficients from the GLM for the
cue features. Specifically, for all cue-modulated units, we coded a 1
if the cue feature was a significant predictor in the final model, and
0 if it was not, and calculated pearson’s r comparing an array of the
coded 0s and 1s for cue-modulated units for one cue feature with a
similar array for another cue feature. The NAc was determined as
coding a pair of cue features in a) a separate populations of units if
there was a significant negative correlation ($r < $ 0), b) an
independently coded overlapping population of units if there was no
significant correlation ($r = $ 0), and c) a jointly coded overlapping
population of units if there was a significant positive correlation
($r > $ 0). To investigate more finely the temporal dynamics of the influence of task parameters to unit activity, we then fit a sliding window GLM with the same task parameters using 500 ms bins and 100 ms steps, starting 500 ms before cue-onset, up to 500 ms after cue-onset, and measured the proportion of units and average R-squared value for a given time bin where a particular predictor contributed significantly to the final model. To control for the amount of units that would be affected by a predictor by chance, we shuffled the trial order of firing rates for a particular unit within a time bin, and took the average of this value over 100 shuffles. We then calculated how many z-scores the observed proportion was from the mean of the shuffles samples, using a z-score of greater than 1.96 as a marker of signifiance.

To get a sense for the predictive power of these cue feature representations we trained a classifier using firing rates from a pseudoensemble of our 133 cue-modulated units (Figure \ref{fig:LDA}). We created a matrix of firing rates for each time epoch surrounding cue-onset where each row was an observation representing the firing rate for a trial, and each column was a variable representing the firing rate for a given unit. Trial labels, or classes, were each condition for a cue feature (e.g.\ light and sound for cue identity) when trying to predict each cue feature, and combinations of conditions across cue features when trying to make more specific predictions (e.g.\ light reward-available, light reward-unavailable, sound reward-available, sound reward-unavailable), making sure to align trial labels across units. We then ran LDA on these matrices, using 10-fold cross validation to train the classifier on 90\% of the trials and testing its predictions on the held out 10\% of trials, and repeated this approach to get the classification accuracy for 100 iterations. To test if the classification accuracy was greater by chance, we shuffled the order of firing rates for each unit before we trained the classifier. We repeated this for 100 shuffled matrices for each time point, and calculated how many z-scores the mean classification rate of the observed data was from the mean of the shuffled samples, using a z-score of 1.96 as the cut off for a significant deviation from the permuted distribution.

To better visualize responses to cues and enable subsequent population
level analyses (as in Figures \ref{fig:examples}, \ref{fig:pop}, and
\ref{fig:tiling}), spike trains were convolved with a Gaussian kernel
($\sigma$ = 100 ms), and peri-event time histograms (PETHs) were
generated by taking the average of the convolved spike trains across all
trials for a given task condition. For analysis of population-level
responses for cue features (Figure \ref{fig:pop}), convolved spike
trains for all units where cue identity, cue location, or cue outcome
explained a significant portion of firing rate variance were
z-scored. Within a given cue feature, normalized spike trains were
then separated according to the preferred and non-preferred cue
condition (e.g.\ light vs.\ sound block), and averaged across units to
generate population-level averages. To account for separation that
would result from any random selection of units, unit identity was
shuffled and the shuffled average for preferred and non-preferred cue
conditions was generated for 1000 shuffles.

To visualize NAc representations of task space within cue conditions,
normalized spike trains for all units were ordered by the location of
their maximum or minimum firing rate for a specified cue condition
(Figure \ref{fig:tiling}). To compare representations of task space
across cue conditions for a cue feature, the ordering of units derived
for one condition (e.g.\ light block) was then applied to the
normalized spike trains for the other condition (e.g.\ sound
block). For control comparisons within cue conditions, half of the
trials for a condition were compared against the other half. To look
at the correlation of firing rates of all units within and across
various cue conditions, trials for each cue condition for a unit were
shuffled and divided into two averages, and averages within and across
cue conditions were correlated. A linear mixed effects model was run
for each cue condition to determine if correlations of firing rates
within cue conditions were more similar than correlations across cue
conditions.

To identify the responsivity of units to different cue features at the time of a nosepoke into a reward receptacle, and subsequent reward delivery, the same cue-responsive units from the cue-onset analyses were analyzed at the time of nosepoke and outcome receipt using identical analysis techniques for all approach trials (Figures \ref{fig:NP_examples}, \ref{fig:NP_GLM}, \ref{fig:NP_pop}, and \ref{fig:NP_tiling}). To compare whether coding of a given cue feature was accomplished by the same or distinct population of units across time epochs, we ran the recoded coefficient correlation that was used to assess the degree of overlap among cue features within a time epoch.

All analyses were completed in MATLAB R2015a, the code
is available on our public GitHub repository
(http://github.com/vandermeerlab/papers), and the data can be accessed
through DataLad.

{\bf Histology:}

Upon completion of the experiment, recording channels were gliosed by passing 10 $\mu A$ current for 10 seconds and waiting 5 days before euthanasia, except for rat R057 whose implant detached prematurely. Rats were anesthetized with 5\%
isoflurane, then asphyxiated with carbon dioxide. Transcardial
perfusions were performed, and brains were fixed and removed. Brains
were sliced in 50 $\mu m$ coronal sections and stained with
thionin. Slices were visualized under light microscopy, tetrode
placement was determined, and electrodes with recording locations in
the NAc were analyzed (Figure \ref{fig:histo}).
